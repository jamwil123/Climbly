        "description1": "A' Bhuidheanach Bheag is a Scottish mountain situated on the eastern side of the Pass of Drumochter, some 24 km WNW of Blair Atholl. The mountain straddles the border between Highland and Perth and Kinross council areas although the actual summit is in the latter.[3]\n",
        "description2": "The high ground to the east side of the Pass of Drumochter takes the form of a huge undulating plateau, with an average height of over 800 metres, which stretches NE for 13 km to Loch an t-Seilich in the Gaick Forest. This area is often dismissed as uninteresting countryside, however it does contain two Munros which draws many walkers to the locale. A' Bhuidheanach Bheag lies to the southern end of the plateau and when viewed from the A9 road it shows many shallow ravines and gullies. The actual summit is out of sight from the A9 being sited back from the edge of the plateau. The rolling nature of the terrain makes A' Bhuidheanach Bheag a good hill for ski mountaineering.[4][5]\n",

The mountain forms a ridge starting with Ben Arthur The Cobbler in the south by Ardgartan through Beinn Narnain to A' Chrois in the north by Glen Loin, visible to Loch Lomond. A'Chrois also provides the eastern gateway to the Arrochar Alps and can be climbed via by Beinn Narnain or Succoth. It is classed as a Corbett Top of Beinn Narnain.\n",

It is well seen by travellers on the A9 to which it shows it more steeper and rugged eastern flanks with a high corrie located just beneath the summit. The mountains names translates from the Gaelic as \"the horse place\" and dates from a time when horses were a valuable element of the economy of the region: places where horses gathered would be noted and named accordingly.[2] The hill is crossed by the border between Perth and Kinross and Highland areas or in the old day Perthshire and Inverness-shire and is marked by old rusting fence posts which can be used as an aid to navigation when traversing the hill.[3]\n",

Its grassy slopes are in marked contrast to the rockier peaks of the other Glen Shiel hills. it is often climbed along with the adjoining Munro of Ciste Dhubh with the route over Am Bàthach providing a more interesting and drier route to the Munro than the boggy An Caorann Beag glen. The hill offers an interesting half day walk when ascended on its own and it is frequently the only one of the Kintail mountains in the clear when weather conditions are poor. Am Bàthach's roof like shape made up of a long NE-SW ridge with steep sides is alleged to resemble a cow shed or a byre and that is the meaning of its translated name, a throwback to the time when cattle where a prominent feature of the Scottish Highlands.[1]\n",

The closest approach to the mountain is from Kinlochleven to the south, however the mountain is often approached along its north eastern or eastern ridges as part of the highly rated “Ring of Steall” ridge walk which starts and finishes in Glen Nevis and climbs the other Munros of An Gearanach, Stob Coire a' Chàirn and Sgurr a' Mhàim.[3] Am Bodach translates from the Gaelic as “The Old Man”, this name was often given to a conspicuous hill overlooking a community and it was probably named by settlers at the head of Loch Leven which the mountain overlooks.[4] The mountain should not be confused with another Am Bodach at the eastern end of the Aonach Eagach ridge in Glen Coe.\n",

The mountain reaches a height of 995 metres (3,264 feet) and is usually climbed in conjunction with the neighbouring Munro of Beinn a' Chroin[2] to which it is connected by a high col to the south east. The mountains name translates from the Gaelic as “the castle” and is believed to refer to the prominent castellated rocks close to the mountain's summit which serve as an easy way of identifying the mountain from a distance.[3]\n",

        "description2": "The easiest ascent of the mountain starts from the highest point of the A859 road between Tarbert and Ardvourlie (Aird a' Mhulaidh), and climbs the broad southern shoulder. A longer and more varied expedition starts at a bridge over the Scaladale River (Abhainn Scaladail) near Ardvourlie, from where the minor summit of Tomnabhal may be ascended before continuing on to the Clisham. Many walkers taking this option continue west then north along the ridge, taking in the summits of Mull bho Dheas, Mulla bho Thuath and Mullach an Langa, thus completing a round known as the Clisham Horseshoe, which involves a degree of scrambling competence.\n",

Apart from Ben Nevis, Aonach Beag is the highest peak in the British Isles outwith the Cairngorm mountains of eastern Scotland.\n",
        "description2": "Aonach Beag is linked to its close neighbour to the north, Aonach Mòr, by a high saddle or bealach. The name Aonach Beag (small ridge) might imply that this mountain is smaller than Aonach Mòr (big ridge). However, Aonach Beag is higher; the names refer to the relative bulk of the two mountains rather than their elevation.\n",

        "description1": "The Aonach Eagach is a rocky ridge lying to the north of Glen Coe in the Scottish Highlands, boasting two Munro summits. \nIn length the full ridge continues for 10 km from the Pap of Glencoe at the west to the eastern end at the Devil's Staircase. The central section, some 2 km in length, is very rocky and the route along it requires scrambling ability. The slopes to each side are extremely dangerous, with steep grass and scree slopes hiding even steeper slopes which end in cliffs on both north and south sides of the ridge.\n",
        "description2": "The Aonach Eagach is usually regarded as the most difficult horizontal 'scrambling' ridge in mainland Scotland, though it vies with Liathach (and, in winter, An Teallach) for this title. In his book \"Scrambles in Lochaber\", local climber Noel Williams warns that there are no other ridges in the area that are \"so narrow and so difficult to escape from once committed. Some sections are extremely exposed. This makes it a difficult outing to grade, because the technical difficulties are not great\".[4] Williams settled on grade 2, implying it is easier than the (optional) grade 2/3 approach scramble up A'Chailleach, but added a further warning (in bold type) that \"there are no safe descents on the south side of the ridge\".[5]\n",

It is the highest point (county top) of the historic county of Merionethshire (for local government purposes, it lies within the current council area of Gwynedd). It is the only peak in Wales outside North Snowdonia above 900m, and higher than anywhere in Great Britain outside Northern Snowdonia, the Scottish Highlands (and islands) and the Lake District. The nearest urban centres to the mountain are Dinas Mawddwy to the south, Llanymawddwy to the southeast, Llanuwchllyn on the shores of Bala Lake to the north, and Rhydymain to the west. \nThe nearest settlements with around 2,000 people are Bala and Dolgellau. On the eastern slopes of Aran Fawddwy is the small lake named Creiglyn Dyfi, the source of the River Dyfi. Its sister peak is Aran Benllyn at 885 metres (2,904 ft).[2] There is also a middle peak- Erw y Ddafad-ddu.\n",
        "description2": "A cairn is placed on the eastern ridge as a memorial to RAF Mountain Rescue team member Michael Robert Aspain who was struck and killed by lightning in 1960.[3]\n",

        "description1": "Ard Crags is a fell in the Lake District in Cumbria, England, it is situated in the Newlands Valley just off the minor road between Keswick and Buttermere. The Ordnance Survey officially records the fell's altitude at 581 metres (1,906 feet), considerably more than the approximate 1,860 feet that Alfred Wainwright attributed to it in his Pictorial Guide to the North Western Fells, published in 1964 well before the advent of satellite mapping. Ard Crags is situated close to other higher fells such as Causey Pike and Eel Crag and can be easily overlooked. However, viewed from certain points in the Rigg Beck or Newlands valley area it presents a clearly defined and pyramidal shape which catches the eye.\n",
        "description2": "A long high ridge sweeps east from Whiteless Pike, via Wandope, Crag Hill, Sail (Lake District) and Causey Pike, crossing from Buttermere to Stair. Running parallel to the south is a lower ridge, a tenuous connection made centrally at Sail. This lower ridge consists of Knott Rigg and Ard Crags, and has a beautiful narrow and airy character. Ard Crags forms the eastern half of the ridge, rising between Keskadale and the side valley of Rigg Beck. It is sometimes referred to as Aikin Knott, the name of the rash of rock on the nose of the ridge.\n",

Wainwright chose to define the fell between these narrow limits,[1] assigning the wider slopes around Moor Divock to Loadpot Hill, and that convention is followed here.\n",

Alfred Wainwright gave Bakestall a separate chapter in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells because of the impressive Dead Crags which fall beneath the summit and the fine waterfall of Whitewater Dash at the fells foot. Indeed Bakestall was not even mentioned on the old Ordnance Survey one-inch map for many years, a situation now rectified on its metric equivalent probably because of Wainwright’s having drawn attention to the fell.\n",

Its SW slopes drops away steeply and rockily towards Loch a’ Ghobhainn while its NE slopes are less precipitous, throwing out a series of spurs which produces three craggy corries. Strong hill walkers can climb Baosbheinn with the adjacent Corbett of Beinn an Eoin which stands across Loch na h-Oidhche and gives a demanding circular walk of 21 km (13 mi) which takes between six and nine hours.[3]\n",

The mountain looks impressive from the north west throwing down steep wall like slopes and along with the three adjoining Munros of Beinn Dorain, Beinn an Dothaidh, and Beinn a' Chreachain it forms the historical Great Wall of Rannoch, which was the boundary between the old Pictish Kingdom to the east and the Dál Riata kingdom of the Scots in the west.[2] \n",

The mountain stands in the Forest of Mamlorn, an ancient deer forest in Breadalbane.\n",

It stands at the head of Glen Lochay and is a prominent peak when seen from the head of that glen, its western slopes dominate the north eastern side of Strath Fillan. When seen from the south the summit of the mountain cannot be seen, being hidden behind the south top. The mountain name was originally written as Beinn Challuim before Ben Challum became the norm. However in recent years the Ordnance Survey have reverted to using the original name on their maps.\n",

Further west is the rest of the wild Argyll scenery and marks the first real sense of isolation and wilderness after arriving in the Highlands at Loch Lomond.\n",

        "description2": "Beinn Chùirn reaches a height of 880 metres (2,890 feet) and qualifies as a Corbett and a Marilyn. It stands in the Cononish valley in the company of three other mountains (Ben Lui, Ben Oss and Beinn Dubhchraig which are all Munros and tend to overshadow the smaller hill. When seen from the east, Beinn Chùirn looks like a smaller version of the neighbouring Ben Lui, both having impressive east-facing corries; it is sometimes mistaken for Ben Lui by motorists on the A82 road in Strath Fillan. The hill's name translates from the Gaelic language as \"cairn hill\",[1] This is thought to have originated because the hill was an important point on the ancient boundary between the kingdoms of the Picts and Dál Riata.[2] In recent years the hill has received some publicity after the discovery of a vein of gold on its slopes.\n",

        "description1": "Beinn Eighe is a complex mountain massif in the Torridon area of Wester Ross in the Highlands of Scotland. Lying to the south of Loch Maree, it forms a long ridge with many spurs and summits, two of which are classified as Munros. The name Beinn Eighe comes from the Scottish Gaelic  meaning file mountain.[3] Unlike most other hills in the area it has a cap of Cambrian basal quartzite which gives the peaks of Beinn Eighe a distinctive light colour. Its complex topography has made it popular with both hillwalkers and climbers and the national nature reserve on its northern side makes it an accessible mountain for all visitors.\n",
        "description2": "Located between Loch Maree and Glen Torridon on the west coast of Scotland, Beinn Eighe is a complex mountain. The main ridge runs on a line extending from close to the village of Kinlochewe in the north-east to the narrow glen of the Coire Dubh Mòr, which separates it from the neighbouring mountain of Liathach to the south-west. The slopes into Glen Torridon on the south side are steep with few features and are covered in white quartzite screes. On the north side are four large corries between which are spurs extending out from the main ridge.[4] The southern and eastern sides of the mountain are flanked by the A896 and A832 roads, however the area to the northwest is largely unpopulated, comprising the mountainous landscape of the Torridon Hills and the Flowerdale Forest.[5]\n",

It lies on the popular path to Ben Lawers from the National Trust for Scotland car park, with the result that many walkers traverse the summit of Beinn Ghlas without realising it. The popularity of the path meant that it suffered from severe erosion, but it has been reconstructed in recent years.\n",

From Succoth, one may follow the same path that is used to reach The Cobbler before taking the right fork near the base of the Cobbler's main crags and continuing up the glen, across the bealach and up Ben Ìme's eastern ridge. Alternatively, the summit can be reached from the pass of Rest and be Thankful and from the Loch Lomond side, using the private road that leads to Loch Sloy.\nBeinn Ìme separates the Dunbartonshire landscape of Loch Lomond in the East and the Argyll Highlands of Loch Fyne and Loch Goil anywhere north, west, south west. Beinn Ìme is the landmark to the entrance to Argyll.\n",

        "description1": "Beinn Liath Mhòr is a Scottish mountain situated in the mountainous area between Strath Carron and Glen Torridon in Wester Ross in the Highland region. Geologically Beinn Liath Mhòr is made up of Cambrian quartzite scree and Torridonian sandstones giving the mountain a distinctive colour contrast of light and dark. The mountain's other main characteristic is its two kilometre long undulating summit ridge which does not drop below 800 metres for its entire length. This culminates at the summit at its far western end at a height of 926 metres (3038 feet) making Beinn Liath Mhòr the 258th highest Munro.\n",
        "description2": "The most common approach to Beinn Liath Mhòr starts at Achnashellach on the A890 road and goes by the right of way to Glen Torridon. This follows the impressive Coire Lair, a rugged corrie surrounded by three imposing mountains, the other two being Sgorr Ruadh (which is also a Munro) and Fuar Tholl which is ranked as one of the finest Corbetts by mountain writers. The Coire Lair path is followed for two kilometres until the path forks, here the right hand fork is taken across moorland for 0.5 kilometre until reaching the steep climb of Beinn Liath Mhòr’s south east ridge, which leads directly to the summit plateau. The summit ridge consists of light coloured quartzite stones, whilst the highest point at the far end is crowned by a quartzite cairn. It is also possible to climb Beinn Liath Mhòr from Glen Torridon starting at the car park at grid reference  WikiMiniAtlasNG957568 and following the Ling path to its termination and then ascending the mountain by its western ridge.\n",

        "description2": "The summit is broad and flat. It is noted for its summit tors; large boulders left by retreating ice sheets at the end of the last ice age. The highest point of the hill is, in fact, the top of one of the largest tors, and an easy scramble is required to reach it.\n",

        "description2": "Beinn Narnain is usually climbed from Succoth at the head of Loch Long. The most commonly used route starts by climbing directly up the hillside, following a line of concrete blocks that were originally supports for a cable railway used during the construction of watercourse diversions forming part of the Loch Sloy hydro-electric scheme[2] (Until the construction of new path, this was also the route towards The Cobbler). At one point the path crosses a level track, and one must continue by climbing some exposed rock immediately opposite - this appears to be part of the stream bed and not the path.\n",

It stands four km (2.5 mi) north of Tyndrum, a location with which it has strong ties, being well seen from the village. The mountain lies on the border between Argyll and Bute and Stirling council areas within the Auch and Invermeran estate.\n",
        "description2": "Beinn Odhar reaches a height of 901 metres (2956 feet) making it the 18th highest Corbett,[1] failing to make Munro status by just 13 metres. The hill also qualifies as a Marilyn having a considerable prominence of 457 metres making it an excellent viewpoint. The grassy, steep, conical shape of Beinn Odhar is a well-known sight for vehicles travelling on the A82 road and for walkers on the West Highland Way, both of which pass on the immediate western side of the mountain. Beinn Odhar stands four km south of the Munro Beinn Dorain, both mountains being similar in shape and character and the possibility of confusing the two peaks by a cursory glance is not impossible.\n",

The West Highland Railway travels across the base of the mountain on its western side as it loops dramatically over the Auch Glen and Glen Coralan on two viaducts. Beinn a' Chaisteil is usually climbed with the adjoining Beinn nam Fuaran to which it is joined by a col with a height of 546 metres. Strong walkers will include the mountain in the traverse of the \"Auch Corbetts\", an 18 km walk with almost 2000 metres of ascent which takes in the four other Corbetts of Beinn Odhar, Beinn Chaorach, Cam Chreag and Beinn nam Fuaran.\n",

The hill is well seen from the upper part of Glen Falloch from where the long summit ridge and the steep head wall of Coire Earb can be appreciated. The translation of the mountains name from the Gaelic language is vague and there are three possible meanings. Some sources give the translation as “Hill of Danger”[3] although Beinn a’ Chroin is no more dangerous than any other peak in the group. Other sources give the meaning as “Hill of the Sheep Fold”[4] while others give it as “Hill of the Cloven Hoof”[5] referring to the mountains twin summits.\n",

Although included in Sir Hugh Munro's original list of Scottish mountains over 3000 feet,[1] subsequent surveys showed it to be significantly shorter than the 914.4 m cut-off limit required to count as a Munro. Nonetheless, it remains a popular mountain, and is often quoted as an example of an interesting mountain below 3000 feet to show that there is more to mountaineering in Scotland than just Munro-bagging.\n",
        "description2": "Beinn an Lochain is usually climbed from the car park at Butterbridge, on the A83 road, at the head of Glen Kinglas. From there, the summit is reached after a 2.5 km walk along the mountain's north-east ridge, climbing over 700 m.\n",

        "description2": "Beinn an Òir is frequently climbed along with the other two peaks forming the Paps: Beinn Shiantaidh and Beinn a' Chaolais. The most usual route for this ascent starts from the bridge over the Corran River, and Beinn an Òir is invariably the second peak to be climbed, regardless of which order of peaks is chosen for the route.  Alternatively, it is possible to avoid the other two peaks and climb Beinn an Òir from either of the bealachs that separate it from its neighbours.\n",

        "description1": "Ben Alder (Gaelic: Beinn Eallair) is the highest mountain in the remote area of the Scottish Highlands between Loch Ericht and Glen Spean. The vast summit plateau is home of one of Britain's highest bodies of standing water, Lochan a' Garbh Coire. It is the 25th highest Munro, and due to its remote location, one of the less frequently visited. Situated 19 km from Dalwhinnie and 15 km from Corrour railway station, it is commonly climbed in a two-day expedition, usually taking in its lower neighbour, Beinn Bheoil. There are two bothies near to the mountain: Culra Lodge (closed due to asbestos contamination) to the northeast and Ben Alder Cottage to the south, both potentially providing shelter for walkers in the area. Ben Alder Cottage is reputed to be haunted by the ghost of a ghillie who hanged himself from the rafters.\n",
        "description2": "If a mountain bicycle is used on, or permission is obtained to drive on the track along the north west shore of Loch Ericht, Ben Alder is one of six Munros that a fit climber may be able to summit on a single late spring or early summer day.\n",

        "description1": "Ben Lawers (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Labhair)[2] is the highest mountain in the southern part of the Scottish Highlands. It lies to the north of Loch Tay, and is the highest point of a long ridge that includes seven Munros.[3] It is the highest peak in Perthshire,[4] and is the tenth highest Munro in Scotland. Ben Lawers was long thought to be over 4,000 feet (1,219.2 m) in height; accurate measurement in the 1870s showed it to be some 17 feet (5.2 m) short of this figure.[5]\n",
        "description2": "Ben Lawers lies on the watershed between the rivers Tay and Lyon. Since the 1950s, water has been captured from the numerous burns on the south face of Ben Lawers and Meall nan Tarmachan as part of the Breadalbane Hydro-Electric Scheme. The water is diverted to the Lochan na Lairige, from where it is piped to drive hydro-electric turbines at Finlarig on the banks of Loch Tay.[4] The level of the Lochan na Lairige was raised by the construction of the 344-metre-long Lawers Dam, a buttress-type dam that is 42 m high. Due to the height of this reservoir the static head of water is 415 m, the highest available on any hydro-electric scheme in Scotland.[6]\n",

It lies about six kilometres (four miles) northwest of Callander, near the village of Kilmahog. It is situated in the Trossachs, an area often regarded as having some of the most romantic scenery in the Highlands.\n",
        "description2": "Ben Ledi is particularly well known through Walter Scott's poem Lady of the Lake. Supposedly in ancient times,  Beltane rites were observed on the summit.[1] There are what is thought to be possible references to these Beltane rights in some of the Gaelic names on the mountain: Creag Ghorn; 'Rock of Embers' and Creag Loisgte; 'Burned Rock'. In 1791 the Rev Doctor James Robertson being minister of the parish at the time, was required to write a description of the parish for the First Statistical Account of Scotland. In his report he mistakenly (due to the similarity to le dia) took the name Ben Ledi to mean 'hill of god' which suited the purposes of the kirk of the day. The name is in fact a corruption of Beinn Leitir which translates to 'the Hill of the Slope', which is a very suitable description of the long south shoulder used to access the summit. A cairn was built on the top in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria's jubilee.\n",

The name translates as \"big mountain of Assynt\", and with a height of 998 metres (3,274 feet) it is the highest point in Sutherland.\n",
        "description2": "The mountain lies in the east of Assynt, set apart from the area's better known and more dramatic (but lower) mountains such as Suilven. It is hidden from the traveller on the A837 road by the adjacent Munro of Conival, and the best views of it are obtained from nearby summits. The higher slopes of the mountain are capped by light coloured quartzite boulders, giving it a distinctive appearance.\n",

For most of the route, there are excellent views westward over the Glenkens[5] to the Rhinns of Kells in the Galloway Hills. According to a tourist information board placed at The Green Well at the start of the track, in good conditions, the mountains of England, Wales, Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland can be seen from the summit, as well as Glasgow and Edinburgh, some 80 miles distant.\n",

There are views of Llwytmor and Foel-fras to the north-east, Garnedd Uchaf to the south-east, Bera Bach to the south, Drosgl to the west and the Menai to the north-west.[1] \n",

It was in a bog in the northern foothills of Bera Mawr, at a place called Nanhysglain, that Prince Dafydd ap Gruffudd and his family were betrayed and captured in June 1283 during the Conquest of Wales by Edward I. In October, Dafydd was executed at Shrewsbury on the orders of Edward I. His death marked the end of the 700-year rule of Gwynedd by the family descended from Cunedda Wledig and an independent Wales.[2]\n",

To the south, a short narrow ridge links to the main ridge at an unnamed 1062 m subsidiary top listed in Munro's Tables as Binnein Mòr south top.

        "description1": "Birkhouse Moor is a fell in the English Lake District, an outlier of the Helvellyn range in the Eastern Fells. It is properly an eastern ridge of Helvellyn, but was treated as a separate fell by Alfred Wainwright in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. That convention is followed here.\n",
        "description2": "Running east from the summit of Helvellyn is Striding Edge, a knife-edged arête which provides the most famous fell-walking in the District. The ridge turns a little to the north at the rocky turret of High Spying How and then drops to a grassy saddle, known as Hole-in-the-Wall. North east of here the ridge broadens into a wide plateau, appearing in plan like a three taloned claw. This plateau, about a mile wide, is Birkhouse Moor. The three talons are the short spurs of Keldas, The Nab and the unnamed northern ridge.\n",

        "description1": "Birks Fell is a hill in the Yorkshire Dales, near to Hubberholme in North Yorkshire, England.[1] It is classed as a Marilyn (a hill with topographic prominence of at least 150m). Birks Fell only became an official Marilyn in 2006 as it was resurveyed and discovered to be 610 metres (2,001 ft) and not 608 metres (1,995 ft) as previously thought. Books from the late 19th  and early 20th centuries list the hill as being 2,001 feet (610 m)[2] and it is thought that in the conversion to metric, the hill lost some height.[3] This raises it above neighbouring Horse Head Moor (609 m), making it the Marilyn in place of Horse Head Moor.\n",
        "description2": "Between the summit and a trig point (1 mile (1.6 km) to the south west) lies Birks Tarn, which is one or the largest tarns in the Yorkshire Dales. It is prevented form leaking through the bedrock underneath by its impermeable layers and additionally held back by the peaty soil.[4] The section at the top of the fell is a wide ridge that offers excellent walking and \"outstanding views\".[5]\n",

It is the highest point of the Loweswater Fells, an area of low grassy hills with steep sides overlooking the lake of Loweswater. The fell also overlooks the village of Loweswater, from which it can be climbed. An alternative route is from the Cogra Moss reservoir on its western slopes. Because the Loweswater Fells are a separate geographical unit, Blake Fell is a Marilyn. It is located in the Parish of Lamplugh.\n",
        "description2": "The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.[1] Blake Fell and the other Loweswater Fells form the extremity of the northern arm.\n",

        "description1": "Bleaberry Fell is a fell in the Lake District in Cumbria, England, with a height of 590 metres (1,936 feet). It stands on the main watershed between Borrowdale and Thirlmere and can be climbed from either flank. Walla Crag is a subsidiary top of Bleaberry Fell.\n",
        "description2": "Situated in the central area of the national park, four kilometres (2½ miles) south of Keswick, Bleaberry Fell is the northernmost top on the ridge that separates the valleys containing the lakes of Derwent Water (Borrowdale) and Thirlmere. This ridge, which also contains the fells of High Seat and High Tove, is notoriously boggy underfoot, but Bleaberry Fell is mostly dry and the heather-covered summit gives an excellent all-round vista. To the east the fell has the rock faces of Iron Crag and Goat Crags as it falls away towards the Thirlmere valley.\n",

Much of it is nearly 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level and the shallow bowl of Swains Greave on its eastern side is the source of the River Derwent. \n",

At 633 metres (2,077 feet), Bleaklow is the second-highest point in Derbyshire and the area includes the most easterly point in the British Isles over 2,000 feet, near Bleaklow Stones.\n",

It is situated in the southeastern corner of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The summit plateau reaches a height of 1,841 feet (561 m).\n",
        "description2": "Blorenge overlooks the market town of Abergavenny and the villages of Llanfoist and Govilon in the Usk Valley to the north. At the foot of the hill lies the Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal. It drops away steeply to the northwest into Cwm Llanwenarth. To the south, gentler slopes fall away to Blaenavon at the head of the Lwyd valley. Prominent peaks seen from the Blorenge include the Skirrid to the east of Abergavenny and the Sugar Loaf to the north. The high moorland ridge continues to the south of the minor road at Foxhunter car park and assumes the name Mynydd y Garn-fawr. The cairn referenced in the title of this southerly shoulder of Blorenge may be that now known as Carn y Defaid which sits on the county boundary at a height of 503m. It is the most prominent amongst a handful of Bronze Age burial cairns.[3]\n",

        "description1": "Bonscale Pike is a fell in the English Lake District, standing above Howtown on Ullswater. It is the northern end of a spur running north north west from Loadpot Hill on the main ridge of the Far Eastern Fells.\n",
        "description2": "From Loadpot Hill the ridge gradually narrows on the approach to Bonscale Pike, first crossing a marshy area and then the domed intermediate top of Swarth Fell, (1,788 ft). The ground from here onward is easy going with a covering of fell grass. Bonscale Pike stands on the north facing point as the boundaries of the ridge converge. Swarthbeck Gill on the east –  which separates the fell from its twin, Arthur's Pike – falls to Ullswater through a ravine. The western boundary is formed by Fusedale Beck which also flows to the lake.\n",

The Brontë Way and the Pendle Way both pass along the slopes of Boulsworth Hill, providing routes of ascent from Nelson and Wycoller. A further possibility is to climb from Trawden, the nearest town to the summit, and it was originally intended that Boulsworth Hill would be a highlight of the Pennine Way,[2] which instead passes to the east of the hill. Following the CRoW Act, Boulsworth Hill can now also be legally climbed from the Yorkshire side, near Hebden Bridge.[3]\n",

Bowscale Fell stands at the extreme north east the Blencathra group, connected to this higher fell by the intervening Bannerdale Crags.  In common with many fells the western slopes are smooth and convex while the eastern side exhibits crags.\n",
        "description2": "A curving ridge surrounds the head of Bannerdale, with Bowscale Fell at the northern end and Bannerdale Crags to the south. The ridgeline is broad and grassy with occasional patches of bog and a couple of small tarns in the north. Bannerdale flows due east from the depression between the two fells to its junction with the River Glenderamackin. A second  tributary of the Glenderamackin, Bullfell Beck, runs parallel a little to the north, its source being directly beneath the summit of Bowscale Fell. The heads of the two valleys are divided by a truncated east ridge, The Tongue, which sports a top (1,814 ft) at the far end. From below, The Tongue appears as an impressive pyramidal peak with steep slopes on all sides, obscuring the higher ground behind.\n",

        "description1": "Brae Fell is a fell in the English Lake District, situated 12 kilometres north of Keswick it reaches a height of 586 m (1,923 ft) and is regarded as part of the Caldbeck Fells along with High Pike and Carrock Fell even though it has ridge links to the Uldale Fells. The fell's name has Scottish overtones and translates from the Scots language as a hillside or slope. Its northern flanks face the Scottish Borders country across the Eden Valley and Solway Firth.\n",
        "description2": "Brae Fell is large and grassy and is really an outlying part of Great Sca Fell being situated on that fell's northern ridge separated by a col with a height of approximately 570 metres. With a height of less than 2000 feet and prominence of around 16 metres it fails to be a fell of real importance. Alfred Wainwright gives it a chapter in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, being less than complimentary, saying, “If all hills were like Brae Fell there would be far fewer fell walkers”. It is best viewed from the low ground to the north where it shows off its full height. Brae Fell was mined in the nineteenth century for Lead, the mine lies on its eastern slopes just above Roughton Gill and there are large spoil tips remaining to this day.\n",

The Sedbergh ascent is the most popular, and has the distinction of being on good paths all the way.\n",

        "description1": "Brim Fell is a fell in the English Lake District. It stands to the west of Coniston village in the southern part of the District.\n",
        "description2": "The Coniston (or Furness) Fells form the watershed between Coniston Water and the Duddon valley to the west. The range begins in the north at Wrynose Pass and runs south for around 10 miles before petering out at Broughton in Furness on the Duddon Estuary. Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells took only the northern half of the range as Lakeland proper, consigning the lower fells to the south to a supplementary work The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.  Brim Fell occupies a position in the northern section and therefore qualifies as one of the 214 Wainwrights. Later, guidebook writers have chosen to include the whole range in their main volumes.[1][2]\n",

Like the rest of the range it is composed of gabbro, a rock with excellent grip for mountaineering. The Bruach cannot be seen in the popular view from Sligachan - the right hand peak which is often mistaken for it is the lower Sgurr a' Bhasteir.\n",
        "description2": "This is one of the easiest and probably the most ascended of the main Black Cuillin peaks, requiring no scrambling ability. The simplest route ascends via Fionn Coire, though the slightly harder Northwest Ridge is also a popular route. All routes cross steep ground and scree.\n",

Views from the summit include the full length of the Duddon Valley including its estuary; the western side of the Coniston fells; the Eskdale fells including Scafell and Bowfell; much of western Cumbria including the estuary of the Rivers Esk, Mite and Irt; the Isle of Man; as well as the hills to the south culminating in Black Combe.\n",

A bridleway crosses the fell to the north of the summit, but it is probably more frequently visited on a round including Burn Moor at 1,780 feet (540 m), Kinmont Buck Barrow at 1,754 feet (535 m), and Buck Barrow at 1,799 feet (548 m) from the summit of the Corney Fell road, a route described by Alfred Wainwright in the \"Whit Fell\" chapter of his book The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.[2]\n",

Cadair Berwyn and Foel Cedig to the west are the two Marilyns that form the Berwyn range. The undulating plateau of the range also includes a large number of other summits above 2,000 feet (610 m), including satellite summits of Cadair Berwyn and many which are classed as Nuttalls.[3]\n",

Craig y Llyn forms the headwall of a cwm, and it is to this that the word cadair (chair in Welsh) presumably refers.  Further north along the ridge is Cadair Bronwen, whilst to south the ridge continues to Moel Sych (Welsh pronunciation: [ˈmɔil ˈsɨːx], meaning 'dry hill').\n",

With a summit elevation of 4,084 ft (1,245 m) AMSL, Cairn Gorm is the seventh-highest mountain in the British Isles. The high, broad domed summit overlooking Strathspey is one of the most readily identifiable mountains from the nearby town and regional centre of Aviemore.\n",
        "description2": "Since the 1960s over 600 hectares (1,500 acres) of the north-western slopes of the mountain in Coire Cas and Coire na Ciste have been developed for alpine skiing. The ski lift infrastructure includes a funicular railway in Coire Cas. The corrie south of Coire Cas, Coire an t-Sneachda, is separated from the ski area by a ridge known as Fiacaill a' Choire Chais. The southern slopes of Cairn Gorm overlook the remote Loch Avon (pronounced Loch A'an).\n",

        "description1": "Cairnsmore of Carsphairn is a hill in the Carsphairn and Scaur Hills range, part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland. An alternative name, rarely used nowadays, is Cairnsmore of Deugh. It is the highest hill in the range, and its summit is just under .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}six kilometres (3+1⁄2 mi) northeast of Carsphairn village as the crow flies, in the far north of Kirkcudbrightshire.\n",
        "description2": "The usual route of ascent is from the A713 road to the west at the \"Green Well of Scotland\" a mile north of Carsphairn.[4] Despite its height, it is a relatively easy hill to climb - over some rough grass, with no steep slopes and with a very flat summit area - though there are areas of more rugged ground on the outlying peaks of Beninner and Moorbrock.  For most of the route, there are excellent views westward over the Glenkens[5] to the Rhinns of Kells in the Galloway Hills. According to a tourist information board placed at The Green Well at the start of the track, in good conditions, the mountains of England, Wales, Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland can be seen from the summit, as well as Glasgow and Edinburgh, some 80 miles distant.\n",

The mountain forms an unafforested granite massif, whose highest point is about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) east of Newton Stewart. It is the highest of the \"Solway Hills\" sub-range, and the southernmost of Scotland's 219 Grahams, thus making it, or rather its subsidiary top, Knee of Cairnsmore, the most southerly mountain in Scotland.[4] The view to the south takes in the Cree Estuary and Wigtown Bay, and extends as far as the Lake District, the Isle of Man and Snowdonia.[5] The highest summits of the Galloway Hills can be seen to the north, and Ireland is in the view to the west.[6]\n",
        "description2": "It is home to the most extensive area of open moorland in Galloway, and has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The summit and eastern flanks of the mountain (an area of 1,922 hectares) are designated as a national nature reserve, which is managed by NatureScot.[7]\n",

        "description2": "Càrn Aosda reaches a height of 917 metres (3008 feet), at one point in time it had the honour of being the lowest of the Munros but more accurate mapping techniques have changed this and it is now the 279th ranked mountain in that classification.[2] Càrn Aosda, along with the adjoining Munro of The Cairnwell, is regarded as the easiest of the Munros to ascend,[3] this is because of the high starting altitude of over 640 metres at the ski centre and the easy walking conditions on rough vehicle tracks which lead directly to the summit. A fit hill walker can complete the 275 metre ascent from the centre car park in half an hour.\n",

At an elevation of 1,183 metres (3,881 ft) above sea level, it is the highest mountain in Scotland north of the Great Glen, the twelfth-highest summit above sea level in the British Isles, and, in terms of relative height (topographic prominence), it is the second-tallest mountain in the British Isles after Ben Nevis (its \"parent peak\" for determination of topographic prominence).[2] The highpoint of the historic county of Ross and Cromarty, it is the twin summit of the massif, being mirrored by the 1,181-metre (3,875 ft) Mam Sodhail, to the south on the same ridge.\n",
        "description2": "Administratively, it is in the Highland council area, on the boundary between the historic counties of Inverness and Ross and Cromarty, on the former lands of the Clan Chisholm. The mountain is difficult to access, being 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the nearest road, and its sub-peak to the north, Beinn Fhionnlaidh, is even more inaccessible, unless the Mullardoch Ferry (Jan-Jul) is taken.\n",

Its plateau-like summit attains a height of 602 metres (1,975 ft) above sea level. To the north the subsidiary summit of Cefn y Cylchau reaches 556 feet (169 m), and to the southeast is the subsidiary summit of Carn Fadog  or Cefn Carn Fadog, which reaches a height of 512 metres (1,680 ft).[1]\n",
        "description2": "The hill has a split personality with its northern slopes dominated by the succession of Carboniferous Limestone rocks and its southern slopes by the Twrch Sandstone (formerly known as the 'Basal Grit') of the overlying Marros Group, but also dating from the Carboniferous period. In common with the regional trend the rock strata dip moderately to the south though locally the beds overlying the limestone have foundered as this soluble rock has dissolved away over millennia. There is an extensive area of shakeholes across the entire hill. Carn Fadog is similar in character.  Its summit plateau conceals three small bodies of water. On its flanks are numerous quarries both for limestone and for gritstone.[2]\n",

        "description2": "Càrn Gorm reaches a height of 1029 metres (3376 feet), it qualifies as a Munro and a Marilyn. It is often climbed as part of the circuit of the Càrn Mairg Munros which stand in a curving arc around the Invervar Burn. Càrn Gorm is the first of the hills climbed when the round is walked in a clockwise direction, it is then followed by  Meall Garbh, Càrn Mairg and Meall nan Aighean. Although not the highest of the group Càrn Gorm is often regarded as the finest looking with its summit shaped into a neat cone.[2] The hill lies within the Chesthill estate and large herds of deer are often seen on its slopes. Càrn Gorm translates literally from the Gaelic as “Blue Hill”, but the word gorm is also used for the green of foliage, and probably comes from the dark tones of the grass on the hillside rather than the shady hues of the conifer plantation on its south east slopes which was planted well after the hill was named.[3]\n",

        "description2": "Càrn Mairg is commonly climbed with the other three Munros of the Càrn Mairg group (Meall Garbh, Meall nan Aighean and Càrn Gorm). With a height of 1041 metres (3415 feet) it is the highest of the group and qualifies as a Munro and a Marilyn. The terrain of the Càrn Mairg range is similar to high, rolling moorland with only small depressions between the four Munros, a landscape which is suitable for ski mountaineering and has been likened to the Cairngorms, however the circuit of the hills is a long walk being almost 18 km in length.[2]\n",

        "description1": "Càrn a' Gheòidh is a Scottish mountain situated 15 km south of the town of Braemar. Its summit stands on the border between the council areas of Perth and Kinross and Aberdeenshire.\n",
        "description2": "Càrn a' Gheòidh reaches a height of 975 metres (3199 feet) and is classified as both a Munro and a Marilyn. It is a very accessible hill and when climbed from the Glenshee Ski Centre along with the adjacent mountains of The Cairnwell and Càrn Aosda makes for a very easy round of three Munros for the peak bagger. The mountain is not easily seen to good effect from any main road being completely hidden from the summit of the A93 road by The Cairnwell and Càrn Aosda. It is quite modest in appearance with the smooth slopes of the summit rising unpretentiously above the surrounding high moorland and the hills long ridges.[2] The best views of Càrn a' Gheòidh are obtained from nearby peaks. The mountain's name translates as “Hill of the Goose”, the meaning of which is hard to fathom, although Loch Vrotachan which lies 2km to the NE may have had geese nesting on it at some time.[3]\n",

        "description2": "The mountain is located on one of the two long ridges which radiate south from Ben Macdhui; it reaches a height of 1037 metres (3402 feet) and along with Macdhui and Derry Cairngorm forms the central body of the Cairngorms that lie between the two major passes of the Lairig Ghru and the Lairig an Laoigh. The mountain is notable in that it has the only ridge walk of any significance in the Cairngorms range. Its name translates from the Gaelic as \"Cairn of the large rounded hill\",[2] when viewed from the south it does appear as rounded, although in reality the mountain is a north-south oriented ridge. Another possible meaning of the name is \"Hill of the Pass\" derived from mam or mhaim, meaning pass. The mountain stands at the entrance of the Lairig Ghru pass, so this meaning is a possibility.[3]\n",

The summit was included on the original Nuttall's list, subsequently deleted and then re-included after detailed re-surveying.[1]\n",

        "description1": "White Coomb is a hill in the Moffat Hills range, part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland. Its broad summit is the highest point in the range and the registration county of Dumfriesshire, as well as being the fourth highest point in southern Scotland, however, despite this, it is largely concealed by other hills on all sides except its east and south east, making this the only direction from which its full scale can be seen.\n",
        "description2": "White Coomb is most easily climbed from the National Trust for Scotland car park underneath the Grey Mare's Tail waterfall, on the A708 from Moffat to Selkirk, at NT 186146. The most direct route heads directly west up a steep ridge, but a more comfortable route follows a well built footpath above the north side of the waterfall. Above the waterfall, the fast flowing Tail Burn must be crossed to avoid a long detour; although there are plenty of natural stepping stones, spate or icy conditions may make their use dangerous. From across the stream, the best route through the peat and heather follows the course of a wall leading to the summit of Upper Tarnberry. From there, the east ridge, which is steep and craggy in places, leads to the broad summit.\n",

        "description1": "Causey Pike is a fell in the English Lake District. It is situated in the Newlands Valley, 5 km south-west of the town of Keswick. Even though it has a modest height of 637 metres (2,090 ft) it is one of the most distinctive fells when viewed from the Derwent Water and Keswick area due to its distinguishing summit \"knobble\" which catches the eye. The fell is one of 214 fells described by Alfred Wainwright in his series of Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells: Causey Pike features in Book Six, The North Western Fells.\n",
        "description2": "The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north–south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. The central sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and Newlands Pass, includes Causey Pike. The highest ground in the North Western Fells is an east–west ridge in this central sector, beginning with Grasmoor above Crummock Water and then gradually descending eastwards over Crag Hill, Sail, Scar Crags and Causey Pike.\n",

It is generally associated with the Glen Shiel mountains to the west, although it is the most isolated of that group and is often climbed separately. Ciste Dhubh translates from the Gaelic as “Black Chest”; one possible explanation of this is that the mountain's summit rocks often show as dark in colour when viewed from a distance even in good light conditions (see picture).[2] The mountain should not be confused with another Munro, Sgurr na Ciste Duibhe, seven kilometres (4.3 mi) to the west.\n",

        "description1": "Clough Head ( /klʌf hɛd/) (meaning: hill-top above the ravine) is a fell, or hill, in the English Lake District. It marks the northern end of the main ridge of the Helvellyn range and is often walked as part of the ridge walk. The fell stands south of the village of Threlkeld and the A66 road, and it forms the steep eastern side of the tranquil valley of St John's in the Vale.\n",
        "description2": "On its western side the fell displays a dark mass of rocky crags and a deep-set rocky ravine. On the other side it has smooth grassy slopes. Beneath the north face is the steep valley or clough from which Clough Head gets its name. Also beneath the steep northern face lies the lower hill of Threlkeld Knotts, a granite hill which has been much quarried round its margin.\n",

        "description2": "When travelling clockwise, Crinkle Crags is the last of the high cirque of fells forming the head of upper Eskdale.  It sends out a trio of ridges to the south, running parallel like the prongs of a trident.  Working from the west these ridges culminate in Hard Knott, Little Stand and Cold Pike.  The Cold Pike ridge begins indistinctly in an area of rocky knolls and small tarns beneath the Fifth Crinkle.  Gradually gaining definition it descends to a broad grassy saddle before rising again to the summit plateau of Cold Pike.  To the north of the saddle is Great Knott (2,283 ft).  This top is considered by most guidebooks to be a subsidiary of Crinkle Crags rather than the nearer Cold Pike.[1][2]  Beyond the summit the ridge continues for another half mile south eastward before falling steeply over the many tiered crags of Wrynose Breast.\n",

It is a substantial fell that is part of a long ridge that stretches for over six kilometres from Stonethwaite in Borrowdale up to the important mountain pass of Esk Hause. The summit of Glaramara at 783 m (2,569 ft) is the central point of this ridge, which separates the valleys of Langstrath and Grains Gill. However, the ridge has two additional fells, numerous subsidiary tops and several small tarns making its traverse an appealing and challenging walk.\n",
        "description2": "The fell’s unusual and pleasant-sounding name, previously only applied to the summit rocks, has now been accepted as the name for the whole fell. Like many fells of the district the name comes from a series of Old Norse words which in this case is translated as “Hill with the mountain hut by a chasm”.\n",

The summit itself is marked by a well structured Bronze Age cairn with a central burial cist like that on nearby Pen y Fan. The two summits are visible from great distances owing to their height above the surrounding moorland, and are famous landmarks. The views from the peaks are also panoramic and very extensive, the Black Mountain and Fforest Fawr being especially obvious to the west. Mynydd Epynt is visible to the north behind the county town of Brecon, and other parts of the escarpment to the east.\n",
        "description2": "The summit is often crossed on the way to Pen y Fan, and forms part of a well-known circuit of the Beacons. It offers good views down into Cwm Llwch and across the Usk valley to Brecon as well as east towards the Sugar Loaf, Monmouthshire above Abergavenny.[1]\nTommy Jones' Obelisk is found on its western flanks, in between the summit and Y Gyrn. All of the surrounding moorland is open to access, but crossing some parts of the terrain such as peat bogs is more difficult and the main paths are well-engineered and maintained by the National Trust.\n",

        "description2": "It is surrounded on three sides by the English county of Shropshire and forms a prominent landmark in the Wales-England border. Corndon's prominent western edge appears to form a separate hill and is known locally as Lan Fawr (Welsh: 'Big Hill'). It is frequented by walkers and ramblers from car parks nearby at Mitchell's Fold for example. There are spectacular panoramic views from the summit, and is itself an important landmark for the surrounding countryside and towns like Montgomery. It is close to villages such as Church Stoke and Hyssington.\n",

        "description1": "Cadair Berwyn or Cader Berwyn is a mountain summit in north-east Wales with a height of 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level. It is the highest point in the Berwyn range, the highest in North East Wales and the highest significant summit in Wales outside the National Parks. Cadair Berwyn and Foel Cedig to the west are the two Marilyns that form the Berwyn range. The undulating plateau of the range also includes a large number of other summits above 2,000 feet (610 m), including satellite summits of Cadair Berwyn and many which are classed as Nuttalls.[3]\n",
        "description2": "The mountain lies on main ridge of the Berwyns which runs north–south.[4] The eastern side of the ridge is characterised by steep drops and crags including Craig Berwyn north of the summit and Craig y Llyn to the south.  Craig y Llyn forms the headwall of a cwm, and it is to this that the word cadair (chair in Welsh) presumably refers.  Further north along the ridge is Cadair Bronwen, whilst to south the ridge continues to Moel Sych (Welsh pronunciation: [ˈmɔil ˈsɨːx], meaning 'dry hill').\n",

        "description1": "Craignaw is a hill in the Dungeon Hills, a sub-range of the Galloway Hills range, part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland. Unlike many hills in the Southern Uplands, Craignaw has a complex and rocky summit area, with a long line of crags and rough ground on the east side. The hill is largely composed of granite.[3] Near the north end of the hill is an interesting area of terrain known as the \"Deil's Bowlin' Green\" where various rounded granite boulders are scatterd at random over an area of nearly horizontal granite slabs. These are believed to be glacial erratics or result from a similar glacier process. On the west side of the hill, near grid reference NX458831, a few hundred meters from the summit is an F-111E Aardvark crash site. The site is marked by a small memorial to the two U.S. Air Force pilots who were killed in the accident (Captains Spaulding and Hetzner).[4] Although the crash happened on 19 December 1979 there are still small amounts of aircraft debris in the area.\n",
        "description2": "Craignaw is quite a remote hill and climbing it is a long and rough walk from the road-ends at either Craigencallie or Bruces Stane.\n",

It is a complex mountain, taking the form of a flat summit plateau from which five ridges radiate, and is most famed for the cliffs surrounding the corrie of Coire Ardair on the north-eastern face.[3] These crags are a renowned venue for winter and ice climbing, although being somewhat vegetated they are less suited to summer climbing.[4]\n",
        "description2": "The name Creag Meagaidh is also applied to refer to the neighbouring peaks of Stob Poite Coire Ardair and Càrn Liath which together may be termed the Creag Meagaidh range. All three peaks in the range may be climbed from Aberarder on the A86 road by initially following the path leading up Coire Ardair, before striking north to the summit of Càrn Liath. A circuit of the glen may be made by returning to Aberarder by way of Creag Meagaidh's east ridge. The most direct route to the summit of Creag Meagaidh ascends from the head of the corrie to reach a narrow gap between the crags known as The Window. The Window forms the bealach between Creag Meagaidh and Stob Poite Coire Ardair. Creag Meagaidh may also be climbed from Moy to the southeast.[3]\n",

        "description2": "Creag Mhòr reaches a height of 1047 metres (3435 ft) and qualifies as a Munro and a Marilyn. It is commonly climbed with the neighbouring Munro of Beinn Heasgarnich, which stands 3.5 km to the NE, the two mountains form the high ground between Glen Lochay and Loch Lyon. Creag Mhòr is one of the remotest of the southern highlands[2] being situated about eight kilometres from the nearest public road, it is surrounded by other high ground which make it difficult to get a good view of the mountain from any valley, and the best aspect is obtained from the surrounding peaks. The mountains name translates from the Gaelic as “Big Rock”, an unusual name for a hill which is mostly grassy, however its top has craggy areas and the name refers to a series of rocky buttresses near the summit.[3]\n",

        "description2": "Maoile Lunndaidh is a large and remote mountain, covering an area in excess of 10 square miles (25 square kilometres). Its location is almost equidistant from the valleys of Strathconon, Strathfarrar and Glen Carron, the nearest public road being over 10 km away. The mountain is listed in the current edition of Munro's Tables as 1,007 m (3,304 ft) in elevation. This height dates from the introduction of the 1:50k OS map series in the 1970s. However the current 1:25000 map shows a spot height of 1,005 m (3,297 ft), in better agreement with the trigonometric height of 3,293 ft 10 in (1,004.0 m) on old 6-inch maps (equivalent to 1004.1 metres after conversion to the Newlyn datum).\n",

        "description1": "Crinkle Crags is a fell in the English Lake District in the county of Cumbria. It forms part of two major rings of mountains, surrounding the valleys of Great Langdale and Upper Eskdale. The name reflects the fell's physical appearance as its summit ridge is a series of five rises and depressions (crinkles) that are very distinctive from the valley floor. In Old English, cringol means twisted or wrinkled.\n",
        "description2": "The nomenclature of the various tops is very confused. Traditional guidebooks tend to rely on what the eye sees and therefore focus attention upon the five ‘crinkles’ of the summit ridge. These are generally referred to as the first to fifth crinkles, but Richards[1] starts in the north, Birkett[2]  in the south and Wainwright[3]  employs both conventions, depending upon the direction of travel. For clarity in this article the first crinkle will be taken as the southernmost top. On this basis, the second Crinkle (also called Long Top) is the true summit of the fell. The only other Crinkle with a definitive name is Gunson Knott, but this name is used variously for the third and the fifth, with both the Ordnance Survey[4][5] and the Database of British and Irish Hills[6][7] listing it twice. To the north of the Crinkles proper is a depression and then the outcropping continues over Shelter Crags. \n",

It offers unobstructed views to the Solway Firth, the fells and mountains of Cumbria and the Pennines to the south and east. To the north, the major Moffat Hills are close by and to the west, Queensberry, the Lowthers and many of the Galloway Hills can be seen. Its summit is easily reached from Moffat by taking the Southern Upland Way path east from the Moffat water bridge near Craigbeck. A quite dramatic ridge loop is possible by climbing north on the forestry fire road shortly after Craigbeck Hope cottage via Gateshaw Rig to Croft Head's summit and descending via Cat Shoulder to the junction of the SUW and the Selcoth burn pass.\n",

It has a fine pointed outline and is a well seen from the village of Crianlarich with which it is closely associated. A popular horseshoe ridge walk taking in the mountain starts and finishes in the village. Cruach Ardrain is Y shaped and reaches a height of 1046 metres (3432 feet). The hills name originate from the Gaelic language and its exact meaning is vague and has various translations into English. One popular version being “The High Heap”[2] however Cruach more usually means a stack, giving an alternative translation of “Stack of the High Part”.[3] The name has also been translated in guide books as “High Mound”[4] and “High Slopes”.[5]\n",

A distinctive square grotto marks the summit.  It is part of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks in County Kerry.\n",
        "description2": "Cruach Mhór is at the far eastern section of MacGillycuddy's Reeks in County Kerry, Ireland's highest mountain range.  It is the first major peak in the MacGillycuddy's Reeks Ridge Walk when started from Kate Kearney's Cottage in the Gap of Dunloe.[3]  The ridge between Cruach Mhór and Cnoc na Péiste 988 metres (3,241 ft), is marked by The Big Gun 939 metres (3,081 ft) at its centre, and is considered as offering some of the most exposed and serious hill walking in Ireland (equivalent to The Bones on the nearby Beenkeragh Ridge).[4] The Macgillycuddy's Reeks Ridge Walk continues along this ridge to Maolán Buí 973 metres (3,192 ft) and on to Carrauntoohil, Ireland's highest mountain.[5]  \n",

The peak sits high above the valleys of the Grwyne Fawr and Grwyne Fechan to the north of the more well-known Sugar Loaf. The views from here across the Black Mountains are wide-ranging and also extend eastwards across Monmouthshire. Four ridges run off to the northwest, east, southeast and southwest, the last ending in the subsidiary summit of Blaen-yr-henbant.\n",

        "description1": "Cùl Mòr is a shapely, twin summited mountain in the far north west of Scotland whose higher summit is the highest point of Inverpolly. It is almost completely separated from its southern neighbour, Cùl Beag. Despite its higher altitude, it is less well known than two of its other neighbours, Suilven and Stac Pollaidh, but being higher, it commands views over these and other neighbours.\n",
        "description2": "Cùl Mòr is best approached from Knockan Crag, at NC189095, where there is parking space and from where a stalker's path leads to the foot of the Meallan Diomhain ridge. The route up this ridge is marked by cairns. From the top of this ridge, the most popular route bears right, over a broad saddle, before approaching the summit from the north east. The last part of the ascent is quite steep and involves scrambling over boulders.[citation needed] A slightly longer route is found via the corrie that leads up to the col of Creag nan Calman, to the south west of the main summit.[citation needed]\n",

It is the county top of the historic county of Lanarkshire, as well as the highest point in South Lanarkshire council area. It is the culmination of a network of ridges that lie south of the village of Coulter, close to the town of Biggar.\n",
        "description2": "It is probably most easily climbed from the north west. The best starting point is the mouth of Kings Beck, at NT 031305. Earlier OSGB topographic maps show a public road at this location, but the most recent maps show only a private road, and there are notices threatening to remove unauthorised vehicles. Cars should therefore be parked at Birthwood, 500 metres further back. It is tempting to walk up the track leading up the Kings Beck, but the direct route up the north west ridge is much easier. The slope is smooth and dry, the vegetation is short, and although there is no constructed footpath, helpful steps have been cut by the boots of previous climbers.\n",

This arete is very steep and rope and rock climbing skills will be needed.  To the west is Tyrrau Mawr and Craig-y-llyn, while to the south is Craig Cwm Amarch.[1]\n",

Alfred Wainwright used ‘Dollywaggon Pike’ in his Pictorial Guide, a position supported by other writers.[1][2] One etymology for the word Dollywaggon gives an Old Norse source formed by the combination of dolgr (‘fiend’ or ‘giant’) and veginn (‘lifted’).[3]\n",

        "description1": "Dove Crag is a fell in the English Lake District. Situated in the Eastern Fells of the national park, seven kilometres south-south-west of Glenridding, it reaches a height of 792 metres (2,598 feet). The fell is often climbed as part of the Fairfield horseshoe walk but a direct ascent from Patterdale is required to show the fell's full potential, displaying the impressive crags just to the north east of the summit. The highest point was originally unnamed on maps, being just a minor top, but over the years the summit has adopted the name of Dove Crag by mutual accord..\n",
        "description2": "One of Dove Crag's claims to fame is that it was the first chapter ever written by Alfred Wainwright for his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. He wrote the Dove Crag chapter on 9 November 1952 as he started Book One, after ascending the fell from Ambleside in the previous weeks, making notes and taking photographs. It would take Wainwright a further 14 years to finish the complete series of seven books and 214 fells.\n",

It is a substantial fell that is part of a long ridge that stretches for over six kilometres from Stonethwaite in Borrowdale up to the important mountain pass of Esk Hause. The summit of Glaramara at 783 m (2,569 ft) is the central point of this ridge, which separates the valleys of Langstrath and Grains Gill. However, the ridge has two additional fells, numerous subsidiary tops and several small tarns making its traverse an appealing and challenging walk.\n",
        "description2": "The fell’s unusual and pleasant-sounding name, previously only applied to the summit rocks, has now been accepted as the name for the whole fell. Like many fells of the district the name comes from a series of Old Norse words which in this case is translated as “Hill with the mountain hut by a chasm”.\n",

It was in private ownership until the 20th century, when it was donated to the National Trust by Sir Thomas Acland, Colonel Wiggin and Allan Hughes; a stone cairn was erected at the summit to commemorate the event.\n",

        "description1": "Fair Snape Fell is one of the larger hills in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, England. It occupies a position in the very south of the main range of fells, alongside and just to the north of Parlick, to which it is joined by a ridge. The main paths approach the summit from Parlick in the south, Saddle Fell in the east and Bleasdale in the valley to the west. The Saddle Fell approach is as boggy as the hills to the north. The summit is covered in grass and peat groughs. A trig point and large cairn occupy the top of the western escarpment, with the highest point being about 700 metres (770 yd) to the north-east.\n",
        "description2": "The word snape means ‘pasture’; thus Fair Snape Fell means ‘fell of the fair (beautiful) pasture’.[citation needed]\n",

The Dringarth is dammed to the west to form Ystradfellte Reservoir as is the Taf Fawr east of the hill to form Beacons Reservoir. To the north-east water flows into the Afon Tarell, a tributary of the River Usk whilst to the south the headwaters of the Afon y Waun conduct water to the Afon Hepste and eventually to the River Neath.[2]\n",

        "description1": "Fan Brycheiniog is the highest peak at a height of 802.5 metres (2,633 ft) (above sea level) in the Black Mountain (Y Mynydd Du) region of the Brecon Beacons National Park in southern Wales. There is a trig point at the peak and on the edge of the escarpment, and nearby, a stone shelter with an inner seat. It lies just inside the historic county of Brecknockshire (now part of the Powys council area) which gives the mountain its Welsh name. A subsidiary top (Fan Foel), less than a kilometre from the summit along the ridge to the northwest, is the highest point (county top) of the neighboring county of Carmarthenshire. Fan Brycheiniog is also within the Fforest Fawr Geopark designated in 2005 in recognition of the area's geological heritage.[1] The views of the moorland and open country to the north are spectacular when the weather is clear, and reveals the isolation of the range, especially when compared with the more popular Pen y Fan range to the east.\n",
        "description2": "The Beacons Way, a waymarked long distance footpath heading southwest from Llanddeusant passes along the summit ridge before descending to the southern end of the lake Llyn y Fan Fawr to the east of the summit, en route to Abercraf in the southeast. The path crosses several peat bogs, but there are stone pavements in many places to protect the walker from the wet conditions. There is a stone staircase of regular downward gradient across the escarpment to the lake below. It is easily followed, and is dry underfoot when the weather is clear. The path leads on to Picws Du and Waun Lefrith above the smaller glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fach. Fan Foel and these two peaks form the so-called Carmarthen Van, since they fall within Carmarthenshire, which has its border with Powys at Fan Foel.\n",

It is a subsidiary summit of Fan Brycheiniog. It falls within the county of Powys and is also a part of the traditional area of Fforest Fawr. Its Welsh name means \"long peak\", a fitting description, particularly if seen from the east when its steep eastern face is seen to advantage. It is about 2.5 miles or 4 km long and faces east. Its summit is 2490 feet (about 760m) above sea level. Fan Hir is separated from its higher neighbour to the north-west, Fan Brycheiniog (2633 feet or 802 metres) by a col known as Bwlch Giedd, where a path rises from Llyn y Fan Fawr via a stone staircase.[1]\n",

        "description2": "At 716.7 m (2,351 ft),[1] Fan y Bîg lies at the western tip of the Gwaun Cerrig Llwydion plateau. Its name translates as 'point of the peak' - perhaps in allusion to its striking pointed shape, as seen from some directions. The circumflex accent ('tô bach' in Welsh) over the 'i' lengthens the sound so that it is pronounced 'van-euh-beeg' rather than 'van-euh-big'. The summit is smooth and grassy, but marked by a cairn, which stands on the edge of its precipitous western face. The view of this face from Cribyn is regarded as very striking.[2] Fan y Bîg has since lost its status as a Hewitt.[3]\n",

        "description1": "White Coomb is a hill in the Moffat Hills range, part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland. Its broad summit is the highest point in the range and the registration county of Dumfriesshire, as well as being the fourth highest point in southern Scotland, however, despite this, it is largely concealed by other hills on all sides except its east and south east, making this the only direction from which its full scale can be seen.\n",
        "description2": "White Coomb is most easily climbed from the National Trust for Scotland car park underneath the Grey Mare's Tail waterfall, on the A708 from Moffat to Selkirk, at NT 186146. The most direct route heads directly west up a steep ridge, but a more comfortable route follows a well built footpath above the north side of the waterfall. Above the waterfall, the fast flowing Tail Burn must be crossed to avoid a long detour; although there are plenty of natural stepping stones, spate or icy conditions may make their use dangerous. From across the stream, the best route through the peat and heather follows the course of a wall leading to the summit of Upper Tarnberry. From there, the east ridge, which is steep and craggy in places, leads to the broad summit.\n",

It is bounded by Honister Pass to the north and Warnscale Bottom to the south-west, their two streams uniting beneath the fell in Buttermere. The north west ridge rising almost from the lakeshore at Gatesgarth is named Fleetwith Edge, and is a striking feature from any direction. The top of the fell is situated directly at the top of the edge, while a lower summit stands to the east atop Honister Crag. Fleetwith Pike is lined on all sides by impressive crags, other than for the broad plateau leading across the Drum House to Grey Knotts.\n",

Its plateau-like summit attains a height of 602 metres (1,975 ft) above sea level. To the north the subsidiary summit of Cefn y Cylchau reaches 556 feet (169 m), and to the southeast is the subsidiary summit of Carn Fadog  or Cefn Carn Fadog, which reaches a height of 512 metres (1,680 ft).[1]\n",
        "description2": "The hill has a split personality with its northern slopes dominated by the succession of Carboniferous Limestone rocks and its southern slopes by the Twrch Sandstone (formerly known as the 'Basal Grit') of the overlying Marros Group, but also dating from the Carboniferous period. In common with the regional trend the rock strata dip moderately to the south though locally the beds overlying the limestone have foundered as this soluble rock has dissolved away over millennia. There is an extensive area of shakeholes across the entire hill. Carn Fadog is similar in character.  Its summit plateau conceals three small bodies of water. On its flanks are numerous quarries both for limestone and for gritstone.[2]\n",

Due south and 400 m below lies the reservoir of Llyn Dulyn, while the smaller reservoir of Llyn Anafon lies to the north.\n",
        "description2": "Because of its position, it is the first of the Welsh 3000s reached when doing this walk from the northern end. It can be climbed by driving up the small road signposted \"Aber Falls\" in the village of Abergwyngregyn, passing the car park for the falls and continuing to a small car park at the end of the road. From there it is possible to take the track bearing left, later turning right to the summit of Drum and continuing along the ridge, or to take the track leading straight on to Llyn Anafon and then climbing up to the ridge between Drum and Foel Fras. \n",

        "description2": "It is located on a broad ridge extending northwards from Carnedd Llewelyn to Carnedd Gwenllian (formerly Y Garnedd Uchaf) and Foel-fras. An emergency refuge has been built below the summit. Compared to the surrounding mountains, much deeper snow settles here due to its rather broad summit and high grassy slopes.  On clear days the Isle of Man and even the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland can be seen from the summit.[1]\n",

Confusion arises when trying to establish to which mountain range these belong to. Since, Foel y Geifr forms part of the Hirnant horseshoe, many consider it to be a Berwyn peak. However, geographically it belongs to the Aran Fawddwy group, its parent peak being Esgeiriau Gwynion. It is the eastern outpost of the Arans.[1]\n",

The summit is the highest in a ridge that forms the western backwall of Cwm Hirnant. Two other summit lie along the ridge: Trum y Gwragedd and the Hewitt Foel Goch (Hirnant). To the south-west lies Moel y Cerrig Duon, to the east lies Pen y Boncyn Trefeilw and Cyrniau Nod.[2]\n",

The considerable nose on the face is provided the tip of the Mainreachan Buttress which can just be seen over the outline of the main summit. Fuar Tholl reaches a height of 907 metres (2976 feet) making it the 13th highest Corbett.[1] It fails to reach Munro status by just seven metres, but despite this it is regarded by many as the finest of the mountains in the Glen Carron area.[2] The mountain’s name translates from the Gaelic language as “Cold Hole”, it was probably named by ancient settlers in Glen Carron and refers to the deep eastern corrie which is shaded from sunlight and faces that glen.[3]\n",

        "description1": "Gairich is a mountain in Scotland situated on the southern side of Loch Quoich between Glen Kingie and Glen Garry in the Lochaber district of the Highland Council Area, 25 kilometres north-northwest of Fort William.\n",
        "description2": "With a height of 919 metres (3015 feet), Gairich qualifies as a Munro by just four metres. Despite its relatively low height the mountain is rough and quite isolated with a substantial prominence of 552 metres[2] and is conspicuous in the view up Glen Garry. It is seen as a conical peak when viewed from the Loch Quoich dam (see picture). The mountain was initially named Scour Gairoch on the original 1891 list of Munros[3] and is still occasionally called this, however it is now referred to generally as Gairich which translates from the Gaelic as “roaring”[4] or Peak of Yelling”[5] and is believed to refer to the roaring of stags in the rutting season.\n",

        "description2": "There are several possible routes of ascent. All of them are steep and likely to require scrambling in places. Although most present no technical difficulties in good conditions, careful route finding may be required when descending from the main summit, especially in mist. Most approaches start at the old bridge at the foot of its south east ridge, where there is parking space. From there, the best route of ascent may be up the crest of the ridge, or via a path to the north of this ridge and then up to the saddle between the main summit and its south east top. There are no constructed paths up or onto the ridge, but the boots of successive climbers have created steps which show and facilitate the way in some places, but disappear or are creating erosion in others.\n",

From the summit, distant views to the north can extend as far as Ireland and the Isle of Man, and to the South as far as the Berwyn Ranges.\n",
        "description2": "It lies between Foel Fras and Foel Grach, but is not always included in the Welsh 3000s, as its summit rises only slightly above the ridge. However, it is classed as a Hewitt. Its slopes, like all those in the northern Carneddau, are largely grassy, although they are steep.  The slopes can receive significant accumulations of snow-drifts during blizzards in winter.  In the past, snow beds have survived on the mountain as far as June.  The annual average temperature on Y Garnedd Uchaf is relatively cold, ranging between 4-5 degrees Celsius.[1]\n",

It is a substantial fell that is part of a long ridge that stretches for over six kilometres from Stonethwaite in Borrowdale up to the important mountain pass of Esk Hause. The summit of Glaramara at 783 m (2,569 ft) is the central point of this ridge, which separates the valleys of Langstrath and Grains Gill. However, the ridge has two additional fells, numerous subsidiary tops and several small tarns making its traverse an appealing and challenging walk.\n",
        "description2": "The fell’s unusual and pleasant-sounding name, previously only applied to the summit rocks, has now been accepted as the name for the whole fell. Like many fells of the district the name comes from a series of Old Norse words which in this case is translated as “Hill with the mountain hut by a chasm”.\n",

        "description1": "Glyder Fawr is a mountain in Snowdonia, Wales, the highest peak in the Glyderau range at just over 1,000 metres, having had its height recalculated in 2010 using GPS. It is the fifth-highest mountain in Wales and has several walking and scrambling routes leading to its summit. According to Sir Ifor Williams, the word \"Glyder\" derives from the Welsh word \"Gludair\", meaning a heap of stones.[1]\n",
        "description2": "Glyder Fawr is part of the Glyderau mountain range which lies to the northeast of the Snowdon massif, separated from that mountain by the Llanberis Pass and the Nant Peris Valley. Going from west to east, the Glyderau range consists of Elidir Fawr (924 m or 3,031 ft), Y Garn (947 m or 3,107 ft), Glyder Fawr (1,001 m or 3,284 ft), Glyder Fach (994 m or 3,261 ft) and Tryfan (918 m or 3,012 ft). To the north of the range lie the Carneddau, separated from the Glyderau by the Ogwen Valley and the Nant Ffrancon Valley. The Glyderau are separated from the surrounding mountain ranges making them stand out clearly from afar and giving them commanding views of the surrounding peaks and valleys.[2] Until late 2010, most maps showed the height of Glyder Fawr to be 999 metres (3,278 ft); however, the mountain was resurveyed with accurate GPS equipment and its height was found to be 1,000.8 m (3,283 ft 6 in). A spokesman from the Snowdonia National Park Authority was pleased by the new height, and suggested that now the mountain exceeded 1,000 m, it was sure to attract more walkers to the area.[3]\n",

        "description1": "Gragareth is a mountain straddling the border between Lancashire and North Yorkshire in England.  At 627 metres (2,057 ft), its summit is the second highest point in the post-1974 county of Lancashire.[1] The highest point in modern Lancashire is Green Hill (one metre higher), approximately 3.2 km (2.0 mi) to the north[1] and the Old Man of Coniston in the Furness Fells of the Lake District at 803 metres (2,635 ft) is the county top of the traditional county of Lancashire.[2] The summit of Gragareth lies about 200 m west of the county boundary, but inside the 2016 border of Yorkshire Dales National Park. The western slopes are known as Leck Fell and the southern slopes form Ireby Fell.\n",
        "description2": "The summit has a trig point and extensive views towards Morecambe Bay, the Lake District fells, the Howgill Fells, Ingleborough and the Forest of Bowland. The county boundary wall running along the ridge is believed to be \"one of the highest dry stone walls in the country.\"[3] Historically it formed the boundary between the West Riding of Yorkshire and Westmorland. The Three Men of Gragareth are a group of tall cairns on the western side of the hill above Leck Fell House.\n",

        "description1": "Graig Goch is a 586m high hill in the Gwynedd area in Wales and lying within Snowdonia National Park. The hill falls within the communities of Llanfihangel-y-Pennant and Corris, the summit being located in the former. The hill takes the form of a NE-SW aligned ridge with a broad top which rise to subsidiary tops either side of the main summit. These are the 540m+ top of Mynydd Cedris (OS grid ref SH 707080) and the 504m top of Mynydd Rugog (OS grid ref SH 722092). The hill’s most notable feature is the large cliff which stretches the length of its northwestern face overlooking Tal-y-llyn, in part a major rock-slope failure.[1]\n",
        "description2": "The hill is formed from a succession of mudstones and siltstones laid down by turbidity currents during the Ordovician Period. The main ridge is developed in rocks of the Ceiswyn Formation assigned to the Ogwen Group and dating from around 457 to 454 million years ago. A near vertical cleavage is developed in the steeply southeasterly dipping strata.[2][3] Talus slopes (scree) lie beneath the main cliff, the massive landslip of part of which some time after the last ice age blocked the valley and is responsible for the presence of Tal-y-llyn Lake. The lake occupies a deep glacial trench excavated along the line of the Tal-y-llyn Fault.\n",

        "description2": "The name Great Borne only really applies to the fell's summit area with most West Cumbrians actually referring to the fell as Herdus. However Bill Birkett in his Complete Lakeland Fells gives Great Borne and Herdus the status of separate fells, with Herdus’ summit standing half a kilometre west of Great Borne with an altitude 562 m (1,844 ft). The meaning of Great Borne translates from the French language meaning \"Great Boundary\" as in the 13th century the fell denoted the edge of the Loweswater forest, an alternative meaning has been put forward as \"Great Stream\" from the southern Old English language with bourne meaning a stream flowing from a spring.\n",

As a result, it is distant from roads and quite remote by Lakeland standards.  Great Calva stands at the head of a major geological fault running through the centre of the Lake District, and so from the summit it is possible to see all the way south over Thirlmere. The subsidiary summit of Little Calva lies to the west.\n",

Behind this wall is a further group of fells, commonly referred to as Back o' Skiddaw.[1][2] This group is centred upon Knott and Great Calva is its southernmost top.\n",

Together with its smaller twin, Little Dun Fell, which reaches 842 m (2,762 ft),[1] it forms a stepping-stone for the Pennine Way on its long climb up from Dufton. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Westmorland and the modern county of Cumbria.\n",
        "description2": "At the summit there is a radar station which is operated by National Air Traffic Services and is a key part of the Air Traffic Control system for Northern England and Southern Scotland. A radome containing Primary Surveillance radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) antennas, various towers and fencing crown the summit. Alfred Wainwright abhorred the old radio station (removed in the 1980s) in his book Pennine Way Companion.[citation needed]\n",

It is not the pretty places - the flowery lanes of Grasmere or Derwentwater's wooded bays - that keep him restless in his bed; it is the magnificent ones. Places like Great End...\"[1]\n",

It is named after its appearance as a pyramid from Wasdale, though it is dome-shaped from most other directions. It is one of the most popular of the Lakeland fells, and there are many different routes to the summit. Great Gable is linked by the high pass of Windy Gap to its smaller sister hill, Green Gable, and by the lower pass of Beck Head to its western neighbour, Kirk Fell.\n",
        "description2": "The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards, the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumbria. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells forming a horseshoe around this valley.[1]\n",

        "description1": "Great Knoutberry Hill, also commonly known as Widdale Fell, is a mountain located near Dent at the heads of Ribblesdale, Dentdale and Wensleydale in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The Cumbria/North Yorkshire border runs over the fell. At a height of 2,205 feet (672 m) above sea level[1] it is the 16th-highest fell in the Yorkshire Dales, with Rogan's Seat being exactly the same height.\n",
        "description2": "Great Knoutberry Hill is an imposing sight for anyone walking on the Dales Way Long Distance Footpath on long road section from Ribblesdale to Dent Head. The best approach to its summit is from this section of the Dales Way by leaving the path at Stonehouse Farm and following the Arten Gill path up Dent Fell towards Widdale and leaving it to complete the ascent before returning in the direction one came.\nThe views are pleasant with views centralised amongst the Yorkshire three peaks, to Wild Boar Fell and the Lakeland fells to the north.\n",

        "description1": "High Pike is a fell in the northern part of the English Lake District, it is located 4.5 kilometres south of Caldbeck. It has a height of 658 metres (2159 feet) and is the most northerly of the Lakeland fells over 2000 feet. It is a large fell with its northern slopes falling away towards the lower ground between Caldbeck and Carlisle. Like the neighbouring Carrock Fell it has been extensively mined and the wealth created by the abundant variety of minerals on High Pike led to the saying \"Caldbeck fells are worth all England else\". This fell should not be confused with another Lake District High Pike situated in Scandale near Ambleside.\n",
        "description2": "High Pike’s summit is of some interest, it is used as a beacon by the population of Caldbeck and a fire is lit to celebrate important events such as the Millennium and coronations. The summit also has a massive cairn which was originally a shepherds cottage and has become a ruin. There is a trig point which has been mounted with a plaque which says “To Celebrate Caldbeck Parish’s Millennium Celebrations”, there is also a substantial wind shelter nearby which has also been built from the stones from the ruined cottage. However, the most unusual of High Pike’s summit fixtures is a slate bench which bears the inscription “In memory of Mick Lewis who loved all these fells”, he died in 1944 aged 16 and a small add-on is in memory of his mother who died in 1970. Famous mountaineer Chris Bonington lives in nearby Caldbeck and is he is often to be seen walking his dog on High Pike, he told a local newspaper in May 2005\n",

It is the highest of the four Uldale Fells, the other three being Longlands Fell, Meal Fell and Great Cockup. It is a Wainwright, and the lowest of the lakeland ‘Sca fells’, the other two being Scafell and Scafell Pike.\n",
        "description2": "The Uldale fells are a smooth and grassy sheep pasture which rise in three ridges from the low land to the north and culminate at the summit of Great Sca Fell at a height of 651 m (2,136 ft). Although the hill is a ‘Wainwright’ fell and comfortably crests the 2000-foot mark, it does not meet the criteria for any of the other major hill lists; with a prominence of 13 metres to the higher fell of Knott it narrowly fails to qualify as a Nuttall.\n",

        "description1": "Great Whernside is a fell in the Yorkshire Dales, England, not to be confused with Whernside, some 17 miles (27 km) to the west. Its summit is the highest point of the eastern flank of Wharfedale above Kettlewell. Great Whernside forms the watershed between Wharfedale and Nidderdale, and is on the boundary between the Yorkshire Dales National Park and Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  The River Nidd rises on the eastern slopes of Great Whernside, above Angram Reservoir.\n",
        "description2": "The name Whernside, first recorded in 1214 as Querneside, is of Old English origin.  It is derived from cweorn 'quern' or 'millstone' and sīde 'hillside', so means \"hillside where millstones are found\".[1]  The upper part of the hill is composed of millstone grit, and there were once quarries on the Wharfedale side.  According to one source the name was originally applied to the hillside on the Wharfedale side, and then extended to the whole hill as seen from Wharfedale.  The hill as seen from Nidderdale was known as Blackfell.[2]  The addition of Great was first recorded in 1771, apparently to distinguish the hill from Little Whernside.[1]\n",

This line of high ground continues over many twists and turns for 15 miles, finally meeting the sea on the slopes of Black Combe. From Crinkle Crags the first fells on this ridge are Hard Knott, Harter Fell and Green Crag. Alfred Wainwright considered the remainder of the range unworthy of inclusion in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, stating that \"south and west from Green Crag the scenery quickly deteriorates. This summit has therefore been taken as the boundary of fellwalking country.\" Later guidebook writers have disagreed, adding Great Worm Crag, Yoadcastle, Whitfell, Buck Barrow, Black Combe and the low hills around Devoke Water to their hill lists.[1][2] Wainwright himself later relented and included these lesser hills in a supplementary volume, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.\n",

This is Great Howe, and its steep flanks provide the east wall of Longsleddale, together with further outcrops above the side valley of Stockdale. Grey Crag proper is a second tier of crags, set back from Great Howe and just below the summit, thus giving its name to the entire fell.\n",

Grisedale Pike presents a striking appearance when viewed from the east, particularly from the vicinity of Keswick. It possesses two subsidiary summits: one unnamed (usually referred to as 'subsidiary summit', situated above Hobcarton Crag); the other Hobcarton End.\n",
        "description2": "Grisedale Pike is a large fell throwing down three long ridges to the valley floors and two shorter ones that link to the adjoining fell of Hopegill Head and the strategically important Coledale Hause which links the fell to the rest of the Coledale Fells. It is bounded to the south by the 2½-mile (4-kilometre) valley of Coledale and to the north by the Whinlatter Pass which carries the B5292 motor road. The village of Braithwaite sits at the foot of the long eastern ridge, and some of the northern slopes have been planted by the Forestry Commission, with the Hospital Plantation occupying much of the valley of Grisedale.\n",

        "description1": "High Pike is a fell in the northern part of the English Lake District, it is located 4.5 kilometres south of Caldbeck. It has a height of 658 metres (2159 feet) and is the most northerly of the Lakeland fells over 2000 feet. It is a large fell with its northern slopes falling away towards the lower ground between Caldbeck and Carlisle. Like the neighbouring Carrock Fell it has been extensively mined and the wealth created by the abundant variety of minerals on High Pike led to the saying \"Caldbeck fells are worth all England else\". This fell should not be confused with another Lake District High Pike situated in Scandale near Ambleside.\n",
        "description2": "High Pike’s summit is of some interest, it is used as a beacon by the population of Caldbeck and a fire is lit to celebrate important events such as the Millennium and coronations. The summit also has a massive cairn which was originally a shepherds cottage and has become a ruin. There is a trig point which has been mounted with a plaque which says “To Celebrate Caldbeck Parish’s Millennium Celebrations”, there is also a substantial wind shelter nearby which has also been built from the stones from the ruined cottage. However, the most unusual of High Pike’s summit fixtures is a slate bench which bears the inscription “In memory of Mick Lewis who loved all these fells”, he died in 1944 aged 16 and a small add-on is in memory of his mother who died in 1970. Famous mountaineer Chris Bonington lives in nearby Caldbeck and is he is often to be seen walking his dog on High Pike, he told a local newspaper in May 2005\n",

This is Great Howe, and its steep flanks provide the east wall of Longsleddale, together with further outcrops above the side valley of Stockdale. Grey Crag proper is a second tier of crags, set back from Great Howe and just below the summit, thus giving its name to the entire fell.\n",

The normal route is from the southern ridge,[6] passing over Swatte Fell and can be extended to include a full loop of Blackhope, finishing on Saddle Yoke, known as the Hart Fell Horseshoe.\n",

        "description1": "Burnhope Seat is a high moorland fell in the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in northern England. It lies between the heads of the Rivers Tees, South Tyne and Wear. The summit is crossed by the boundary between County Durham and Cumbria (historically Cumberland). The trig point is the highest point in historic County Durham. However, this is not quite the summit of the mountain (which lies 400 m west and 1 m higher across the border into historic Cumberland). Mickle Fell, south of Teesdale is higher than Burnhope Seat and is sometimes quoted as being the highest top of County Durham, but this is historically not correct. Mickle Fell, although it lies within the unitary council area of Durham County Council for administrative purposes, is historically a part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, and is the highest point in that county. \n",
        "description2": "The character of the fell is very typical of the high Pennines, with an extensive and poorly drained summit plateau of tussock grass and peat bog. The B6277 road between Alston and Middleton-in-Teesdale passes within 2 km of the summit, thus providing the easiest route of ascent. The hill may also be climbed from Weardale as part of high-level circuit of Burnhope Reservoir. There are some ski-tows on the northwest slopes of the hill - this forms the Yad Moss ski facility,[1] which has recently been upgraded by Sport England.\n",

Its summit at 531m is the high point of a peaty plateau which falls away steeply on all sides.  Broad ridges run to the north, the southeast and southwest.  To the north the ridge (known as Hatterrall Ridge) dips to a col at around 485m elevation before rising gradually over several kilometres towards Crib y Garth / Black Hill and Hay Bluff. The ridge to the southwest ends abruptly at the sheer cliff known as the Darren below which is a considerable landslipped area extending south to the hamlet of Cwmyoy with its mis-shapen church. \nThe Welsh part of the hill falls within the Brecon Beacons National Park.\n",
        "description2": "The upper parts of Hatterrall Hill are all designated as open country and so are freely accessible to walkers. Several public footpaths and other public rights of way give access onto the open land from the  Vale of Ewyas (Llanthony Valley) to the west and from the Monnow valley to the east. The Offa's Dyke Path long distance trail runs from north to south over the hill as does the Beacons Way.[1]\n",

Helvellyn was one of the earliest fells to prove popular with walkers and explorers; beginning especially in the later 18th century. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached from all directions.\n",

It should not be confused with the Heron Pike that forms part of Sheffield Pike, although it appears that, by coincidence, both Heron Pikes are exactly the same height.\n",
        "description2": "Not a fell of great significance, Heron Pike is a slight grassy rise on the long southern ridge of its parent fell Fairfield. Just cresting the 2,000 foot mark at 612 m (2,008 ft), it is mostly climbed as part of the Fairfield horseshoe walk and it lies between the adjoining fells of Nab Scar and Great Rigg. Heron Pike’s eastern side features Erne Crag and Blind Cove as it falls away quite steeply towards Rydal Beck. At the base of Erne Crag is an old quarry, the mouth of a cavern quite easy to locate.[1]\n",

        "description1": "High Pike is a fell in the northern part of the English Lake District, it is located 4.5 kilometres south of Caldbeck. It has a height of 658 metres (2159 feet) and is the most northerly of the Lakeland fells over 2000 feet. It is a large fell with its northern slopes falling away towards the lower ground between Caldbeck and Carlisle. Like the neighbouring Carrock Fell it has been extensively mined and the wealth created by the abundant variety of minerals on High Pike led to the saying \"Caldbeck fells are worth all England else\". This fell should not be confused with another Lake District High Pike situated in Scandale near Ambleside.\n",
        "description2": "High Pike’s summit is of some interest, it is used as a beacon by the population of Caldbeck and a fire is lit to celebrate important events such as the Millennium and coronations. The summit also has a massive cairn which was originally a shepherds cottage and has become a ruin. There is a trig point which has been mounted with a plaque which says “To Celebrate Caldbeck Parish’s Millennium Celebrations”, there is also a substantial wind shelter nearby which has also been built from the stones from the ruined cottage. However, the most unusual of High Pike’s summit fixtures is a slate bench which bears the inscription “In memory of Mick Lewis who loved all these fells”, he died in 1944 aged 16 and a small add-on is in memory of his mother who died in 1970. Famous mountaineer Chris Bonington lives in nearby Caldbeck and is he is often to be seen walking his dog on High Pike, he told a local newspaper in May 2005\n",

It is a distinctive fell that has 148 metres (486 feet) of topographic prominence from the higher adjoining fell of Dale Head and so misses being a Marilyn by only two metres. Geologically the fell is made up of Borrowdale Volcanics. The meaning of the fell's name is obscure but may mean a “lookout post”, referring to some lost fort in the area. In the past it has been known as Scawdel Fell and Lobstone Band and these names are still used on maps to label other parts of the fell.[1]\n",

He suggested instead that the name derived from gwylfa, a watching place, noting its similarity with Brown Willy, the name of the highest hill on nearby Bodmin Moor, and suggested that a watch for beacon fires used to be kept here. He also posited a possible link to the word gwili meaning winding or tortuous, but said it was unlikely this was where it originated from.[4]\n",

It is north of Kinder Scout, across the Snake Pass (A57), and south of the A628 Woodhead Pass. Much of it is nearly 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level and the shallow bowl of Swains Greave on its eastern side is the source of the River Derwent. \n",
        "description2": "Bleaklow Head (633 m), marked by a huge cairn of stones, the high point at the western side of the moor, is a Hewitt and is crossed by the Pennine Way. It is one of three summits on this plateau above 2,000 feet, the others being Bleaklow Stones, some 1.9 miles (3 km) to the east along an indefinite ridge, and Higher Shelf Stones, 0.9 miles (1.5 km) south of Bleaklow Head.  At 633 metres (2,077 feet), Bleaklow is the second-highest point in Derbyshire and the area includes the most easterly point in the British Isles over 2,000 feet, near Bleaklow Stones.\n",

Grisedale Pike presents a striking appearance when viewed from the east, particularly from the vicinity of Keswick. It possesses two subsidiary summits: one unnamed (usually referred to as 'subsidiary summit', situated above Hobcarton Crag); the other Hobcarton End.\n",
        "description2": "Grisedale Pike is a large fell throwing down three long ridges to the valley floors and two shorter ones that link to the adjoining fell of Hopegill Head and the strategically important Coledale Hause which links the fell to the rest of the Coledale Fells. It is bounded to the south by the 2½-mile (4-kilometre) valley of Coledale and to the north by the Whinlatter Pass which carries the B5292 motor road. The village of Braithwaite sits at the foot of the long eastern ridge, and some of the northern slopes have been planted by the Forestry Commission, with the Hospital Plantation occupying much of the valley of Grisedale.\n",

        "description1": "Illgill Head is a fell in the English Lake District. It is known more commonly as the northern portion of the Wastwater Screes. The fell is 609 metres high and stands along the south-east shore of Wastwater, the deepest lake in England.\n",
        "description2": "The panorama of the Wastwater Screes across Wastwater is one of the most famous and awe-inspiring views in England. Poet Norman Nicholson described the Screes as ‘like the inverted arches of a Gothic Cathedral’. The title Wastwater Screes applies to the scree-covered north-western fellside which plunges dramatically down into Wastwater. This also includes Illgill Head's neighbour Whin Rigg, the continuation of the ridge to the south-west. The scree slope continues beneath the lake to a depth of 79 metres (259 ft). The screes were formed as a result of ice and weathering erosion on the rocks. Geologically, Illgill Head and Whin Rigg are part of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, typical for the southern-western area of the Lake District. In marked contrast to the north-western slope, the opposite flank of the fell, which descends to Burnmoor Tarn and Miterdale, is much gentler and covered in heather and bracken.\n",

        "description1": "Iron Crag is a mountain in the English Lake District, standing between Crag Fell and Caw Fell.[1] The name of the fell is the source of some confusion, as the summit is unnamed on Ordnance Survey maps. Iron Crag apparently refers to the rocky outcrop below the summit, while the lower slopes are referred to as Ennerdale Fell. The Western aspect of the lower slopes, facing Ennerdale Water is known as The Side.\n",
        "description2": "Iron Crag is separated from Caw Fell by an unnamed col at the watershed of Bleaberry Gill and Silvercove Beck. The Western slopes are separated by a much shallower col leading to Whoap. The gentler southern aspect, which is covered by rough grassland, covers a roughly triangular area, bordered on the South by Caw Fell and Bleaberry Gill, and on the West by Lank Rigg and Whoap. The Ennerdale Wall,  running over the length of the ridge, marks a striking transition in vegetation, with the Northern slopes of Iron Cragg being mostly carpeted by heather.\n",

Wainwright followed this convention in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells.[1]\n",

Randale starts north-westerly, rising quickly before turning due west above approximately 1800 ft. Between these valleys is Kidsty Pike, the east ridge of Rampsgill Head.\n",

        "description1": "Whitfell (or sometimes Whit Fell) is a hill of 573 metres (1,880 ft) in the southwestern part of the Lake District.[1] It is the highest point between Black Combe and Harter Fell on the broad ridge to the west of the Duddon Valley. Views from the summit include the full length of the Duddon Valley including its estuary; the western side of the Coniston fells; the Eskdale fells including Scafell and Bowfell; much of western Cumbria including the estuary of the Rivers Esk, Mite and Irt; the Isle of Man; as well as the hills to the south culminating in Black Combe.\n",
        "description2": "The hill is relatively infrequently visited, and is a fairly characterless grassy mound, extensively grazed by sheep, though with a very large cairn, whose stones may be from a tumulus. A bridleway crosses the fell to the north of the summit, but it is probably more frequently visited on a round including Burn Moor at 1,780 feet (540 m), Kinmont Buck Barrow at 1,754 feet (535 m), and Buck Barrow at 1,799 feet (548 m) from the summit of the Corney Fell road, a route described by Alfred Wainwright in the \"Whit Fell\" chapter of his book The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.[2]\n",

It is situated between Great Gable and Pillar on the long ring of fells surrounding the valley of Ennerdale, and also stands over Wasdale to the south. However, it is separated from its two higher neighbours by the low passes of Black Sail and Beck Head, giving it a high relative height and making it a Marilyn, the thirteenth highest in the Lake District.\n",
        "description2": "The direct ascent up the south-western slope from Wasdale Head is exceptionally steep and the subject of an amusing drawing by Wainwright.[1] Usual ascents are by one of the aforementioned passes; alternatively one may climb Kirk Fell as part of the Mosedale Horseshoe, a walk on the fells surrounding Mosedale, a side-valley of Wasdale.\n",

        "description1": "Knott Rigg is a fell at the head of the Newlands Valley in the English Lake District. It is situated some 8.5 kilometres south west of Keswick and has a modest height of 556 metres (1825 feet). Its name is derived from the Old English language and means “hill on a knobbly ridge”. Because of its moderate height, the fell fails to be listed on any significant hill lists but it does merit a separate chapter in Alfred Wainwright’s Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells.\n",
        "description2": "Knott Rigg is located on a four kilometre long ridge, which springs from Rigg Beck in the Newlands valley midway along its length and runs south westerly to conclude at Newlands Hause. The ridge also contains the adjoining fell of Ard Crags which stands 1.5 kilometres north east of Knott Rigg; both fells are usually climbed in combination with each other. Knott Rigg is steep sided, with the western flank falling away to the valley of Sail Beck, while the eastern side descends to the minor road between Keswick and Buttermere in the Newlands valley. The fell is best viewed from Newlands Hause, where it is seen as a sharp conical peak (although the highest point is not in view), or from Buttermere, from where a complete picture of the fell is seen (although it is rather distant).\n",

It lies in the north-western corner of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, immediately to the east of the Howgill Fells and to the north of Whernside, the highest of the Yorkshire Three Peaks. Formerly in the West Riding of Yorkshire, since 1974 it has been part of the county of Cumbria.\n",
        "description2": "Baugh Fell is bounded by Garsdale to the south and by the valley of the River Rawthey to the west; on the north-eastern side it adjoins Swarth Fell and Wild Boar Fell. The fell sprawls over a wide area, roughly 45 square kilometres (17 sq mi) in size, with generally steep slopes on the Garsdale side and gentler slopes to the west. The Rawthey rises high up on the summit plateau (where it is called Rawthey Gill) and initially flows north, before turning south to form the hill's western boundary. The eastern limit of the fell is marked by Grisedale Beck, the main tributary of the Clough River which flows through Garsdale.\n",

        "description2": "Hopegill Head is the middle fell of three fells on a ridge that starts at Braithwaite and goes west for eight kilometres to conclude at the northern end of Crummock Water. The other two fells on the ridge are Grisedale Pike and Whiteside. The fell is often referred to locally as Hobcarton Pike as it stands at the head of Hobcarton Gill. However, the Ordnance Survey have officially named the fell Hopegill Head on maps after Hope Gill, which is another valley that goes north-west from the summit. Hopegill Head reaches a height of 770 metres (2526 feet) and has two subsidiary summits, Ladyside Pike (703 metres / 2306 feet) and Sand Hill (756 metres / 2480 feet) both of which have Nuttall status.\n",

        "description1": "Great Calva is a fell in the Lake District, England. It is in the Northern Fells, lying roughly at the centre of this region of high ground. As a result, it is distant from roads and quite remote by Lakeland standards.  Great Calva stands at the head of a major geological fault running through the centre of the Lake District, and so from the summit it is possible to see all the way south over Thirlmere. The subsidiary summit of Little Calva lies to the west.\n",
        "description2": "Skiddaw and Blencathra are the best known of the Northern Fells, fronting the range as they loom above Keswick and the road to Penrith. Behind this wall is a further group of fells, commonly referred to as Back o' Skiddaw.[1][2] This group is centred upon Knott and Great Calva is its southernmost top.\n",

Together with its smaller twin, Little Dun Fell, which reaches 842 m (2,762 ft),[1] it forms a stepping-stone for the Pennine Way on its long climb up from Dufton. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Westmorland and the modern county of Cumbria.\n",
        "description2": "At the summit there is a radar station which is operated by National Air Traffic Services and is a key part of the Air Traffic Control system for Northern England and Southern Scotland. A radome containing Primary Surveillance radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) antennas, various towers and fencing crown the summit. Alfred Wainwright abhorred the old radio station (removed in the 1980s) in his book Pennine Way Companion.[citation needed]\n",

To the east it drops steeply into Caiston Glen. On its west side it is connected to Dove Crag by the boggy hollow of Bakestone Moss and to the north east a ridge falls away towards Patterdale going over High Hartsop Dodd before dropping steeply to the valley. The fell is craggy on its northern side as the crags of Black Brow fall into Dovedale.\n",

It is the highest point of the Back o'Skiddaw region, an area of wild and unfrequented moorland to the north of Skiddaw and Blencathra. Other tops in this region include High Pike, Carrock Fell and Great Calva. The fell's slopes are mostly smooth, gentle, and covered in grass, with a few deep ravines. It stands a long way from a road and requires a long walk across the moor top get to it; this, as well as the fact that it is hidden from the rest of the Lake District by the two aforementioned giants, make it one of the most unfrequented tops in the Lakes. When it is climbed it is most often from Mungrisdale or from the north via Great Sca Fell. The word Knott is of Cumbric origin, and means simply \"hill\".\n",

The summit is 849 metres (2,785 ft) above sea level and it contains a series of boulderfields, a shelter and several cairns. It is the 27th highest peak in Wales.\nOn a fine day to the north, the summit offers extensive views towards the Menai Strait, Anglesey and on exceptionally clear days the Isle of Man across the Irish Sea can be seen. The Lake District in England and the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland are also visible on clear days. Carneddau mountain ponies graze on the mountain throughout the year.[1] Its full name Llwytmor Uchaf means \"upper grey sea\".\n",

        "description1": "Long Side is a fell in the English Lake District, it is situated six kilometres north west of Keswick in the northern sector of the national park and is part of the Skiddaw group of fells. Long Side which reaches a height of 734 m (2,408 ft) is located on Skiddaw’s north western ridge, the middle section of which is known as Longside Edge. Strictly speaking the actual summit of the fell is nameless with the name Long Side applying to the south western slope below the summit and is so marked on maps. The fell is often climbed by walkers on their way to the summit of Skiddaw, the route up the north west ridge which passes over Long Side is regarded as being the finest and quietest ascent of that 3,000-foot (910 m) mountain by guide book writers.\n",
        "description2": "Long Side falls away steeply on its south western flank towards Bassenthwaite Lake, these slopes are clothed in the coniferous woodlands of Longside Wood below the 400 metre contour. To the north west the fell descends in steep broken crags to the quiet and unfrequented valley of Southerndale. To the north west the fell connects to the adjacent fell of Ullock Pike by a path that runs for 600 metres along the rim of Longside Edge. To the south east the edge continues from Long Side to link to the higher fell of Carl Side, 800 metres distant.\n",

At 892 metres (2,927 feet) it is the eighth-highest mountain in the Lake District. The fell takes its name from Pillar Rock, a prominent feature on the Ennerdale side, regarded as the birthplace of rock climbing in the district.[1]\n",

Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.[2] Pillar is on the southern arm.\n",

        "description1": "Lovely Seat, originally known  as  Lunasett until being misnamed by map makers some time in the twentieth century, is a fell in the Yorkshire Dales National Park in North Yorkshire, England. It reaches a height of 675 metres (2,215 feet). It is situated at grid reference  WikiMiniAtlasSD878950 three miles (five km) north of the town of Hawes, and is part of the high ground which separates Wensleydale from Swaledale. It is the highest point of Abbotside Common. The fell is separated from its neighbour to the west, Great Shunner Fell, by the Buttertubs Pass which carries the minor motor road between Hawes in Wensleydale and Thwaite in Swaledale. The name  Lunasett derives from the Norse dialect moon pasture; Commoners of Abbotside still use the original name. \n",
        "description2": "The fell is very rarely climbed directly from the valley and is usually ascended from the top of the Buttertubs Pass in conjunction with nearby Great Shunner Fell. The latter is climbed first from Hawes or Thwaite using the Pennine Way, after which it is a short walk to descend to the top of the pass and then climb to the summit of Lovely Seat following a fence which helps navigation in bad conditions.\n",

        "description1": "Low Pike is a small fell in the English Lake District. It has a modest height of 508 m (1,667 ft) and is situated three kilometres north of Ambleside. Low Pike is well seen from the streets of the town as the first prominent fell on the ridge which continues northwards for a further four kilometres to Fairfield. This ridge is part of the Fairfield horseshoe walk and Low Pike is most commonly ascended as part of this.\n",
        "description2": "Despite its modest height, Alfred Wainwright gave Low Pike a separate chapter in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells because \"it is sufficiently elevated above the deep valleys of Scandale and Rydale to give an impression of loftiness which exaggerates its modest altitude.\" Bill Birkett also mentions the fell in his “Complete Lakeland Fells”, but its altitude is not sufficient to be noted on any other mountain lists.\n",

Càrn Eige stands just one kilometre to the north of Mam Sodhail and the two are regarded as twin mountains, being roughly identical in height and appearance. They stand together above Gleann nam Fiadh (Glen of the Deer) and are linked by a high col of around 1045 metres, making the traverse of the two mountains a natural day's walk. Mam Sodhail's name translates from the Gaelic as “Hill of the Barns” although other sources give it as “Breast (-shaped hill) of the Barns”.\n",

Its location is almost equidistant from the valleys of Strathconon, Strathfarrar and Glen Carron, the nearest public road being over 10 km away. The mountain is listed in the current edition of Munro's Tables as 1,007 m (3,304 ft) in elevation. This height dates from the introduction of the 1:50k OS map series in the 1970s. However the current 1:25000 map shows a spot height of 1,005 m (3,297 ft), in better agreement with the trigonometric height of 3,293 ft 10 in (1,004.0 m) on old 6-inch maps (equivalent to 1004.1 metres after conversion to the Newlyn datum).\n",

It is one of three Munros in this area (the others being Sgorr Ruadh and Beinn Liath Mhòr) and reaches a height of 933 metres (3,060 feet), it is slightly isolated from the other two being separated by a low col of 420 metres and therefore tends to be ascended separately. The mountain is typical of the region in that geologically it is made up of a mixture of sandstone and quartzite, it has a steep flanks and is rock-strewn. The dome shaped summit is littered with red sandstone boulders and lacking in vegetation making its translated name of “Bald Red Head” especially appropriate. The mountain is not to be confused with Maol Chinn-dearg, another Munro on the south Glen Shiel ridge.\n",
        "description2": "Maol Cheann-dearg is one of the few Scottish hills which is encircled by good stalkers paths, being located on the Beinn Damh deer estate, these paths can be utilised to do an attractive circuit of the mountain to examine the sandstone cliffs and the picturesque lochs of Loch an Eion, Loch Coire an Ruadh-staic and Loch Coire Fionnaraich which surround the mountain and are frequented by some interesting wild birds. For strong walkers the mountain can be ascended with the neighbouring Corbett of An Ruadh-stac (892 metres) which lies two kilometres to the south.\n",

Despite being surrounded on all sides by higher fells (the Loweswater Fells, the High Stile Ridge and the Grasmoor Group), it stands in isolation. It is surrounded on three sides by a \"moat\" of deep marshy land, and on the east side by the lake of Crummock Water. The fell forms a partnership with the lake, running parallel to it, falling sheer into it, and regularly providing the backdrop for pictures of it.\n",

        "description1": "White Coomb is a hill in the Moffat Hills range, part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland. Its broad summit is the highest point in the range and the registration county of Dumfriesshire, as well as being the fourth highest point in southern Scotland, however, despite this, it is largely concealed by other hills on all sides except its east and south east, making this the only direction from which its full scale can be seen.\n",
        "description2": "White Coomb is most easily climbed from the National Trust for Scotland car park underneath the Grey Mare's Tail waterfall, on the A708 from Moffat to Selkirk, at NT 186146. The most direct route heads directly west up a steep ridge, but a more comfortable route follows a well built footpath above the north side of the waterfall. Above the waterfall, the fast flowing Tail Burn must be crossed to avoid a long detour; although there are plenty of natural stepping stones, spate or icy conditions may make their use dangerous. From across the stream, the best route through the peat and heather follows the course of a wall leading to the summit of Upper Tarnberry. From there, the east ridge, which is steep and craggy in places, leads to the broad summit.\n",

        "description1": "Knott is a mountain in the northern part of the English Lake District. It is the highest point of the Back o'Skiddaw region, an area of wild and unfrequented moorland to the north of Skiddaw and Blencathra. Other tops in this region include High Pike, Carrock Fell and Great Calva. The fell's slopes are mostly smooth, gentle, and covered in grass, with a few deep ravines. It stands a long way from a road and requires a long walk across the moor top get to it; this, as well as the fact that it is hidden from the rest of the Lake District by the two aforementioned giants, make it one of the most unfrequented tops in the Lakes. When it is climbed it is most often from Mungrisdale or from the north via Great Sca Fell. The word Knott is of Cumbric origin, and means simply \"hill\".\n",
        "description2": "Skiddaw and Blencathra are the best known of the Northern Fells, fronting the range as they loom above Keswick and the road to Penrith. Behind this wall is a further group of fells, commonly referred to as Back o' Skiddaw.[1][2] Knott stands at the centre of this group, in addition to being the highest point.\n",

Though not particularly high, compared to other peaks within Scotland, the mountain is very prominent, owing to its isolation and the relative flatness of the surrounding terrain, and dominates the skyline from several viewpoints.\n",
        "description2": "The peak that stands out the most visually is Mither Tap (518 m, 1699 feet) and from its top there are good views of the county to the north and east. Most of the tops lie along an east / west ridge, with the exception of Millstone Hill (409 m) an outlier or spur which is separated from and to the south of the main ridge. Mither Tap has an Iron Age fort on its summit. Unlike with many other hilltop forts in the area, there are no signs of vitrification in the stone.[2] Bennachie is visible from a number of distant points; to the north it is visible from Longman Hill, a point considerably to the north.[3]\n",

The southern slopes are gentle, while the northern aspect is precipitous. The summit has close views of Clogwyn Du'r Arddu and Yr Wyddfa. Views from the summit can extend as far as Holyhead in Anglesey to nearby towns and villages in Gwynedd such as Caernarfon, Llanrug and Llanberis.  On a clear day the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland can be seen across the Irish Sea, at a distance of approximately 80 miles.[1][2][3]\n",

On a clear day the view southwest towards the nearby town of Bala, 3 miles (4.8 km) away is spectacular. Bala Lake, Aran Benllyn and the distant Cadair Idris form a fine vista. The furthest peak visible is Tarrenhendre, 28 miles (45 km) away near Abergynolwyn.[1]\n",

It has a number of western tops, the highest of which reaches a height of 466 metres (1,529 ft) overlooking the waterbody known as Llyn Gelli-Gain and another at Frîdd Wen exceeds 410 metres (1,350 ft). To the south of the lake is the top of Pîg Idris which reaches 429m. The minor top of Y-Foel attains 430m to the northeast of Moel Oernant.\n",
        "description2": "The hill is formed largely from the mudstones, siltstone and sandstones of the Maentwrog Formation and the siltstones of the underlying Clogau Formation, component units of the Mawddach Group of Cambrian age sedimentary rocks. Sandstones and siltstones of the Gamlan Formation of the Harlech Group are also present. An igneous intrusion of microtonalite lies to the west of the summit and the whole hill is cross-cut by dykes of similar material and later dolerite. Some quartz vein mineralization is recorded within the microtonalite outcrop. A number of faults criss-cross the area, the most significant of which is the broadly north–south aligned Craiglaseithin Fault which runs through the summit of the 466m top. The lower slopes are mantled with a patchy cover of glacial till.[2]\n",

At 872 metres (2,861 ft), it is the highest peak in the Moelwynion mountain range. The UK National Mountain Centre, Plas-y-Brenin, is located at the foot of Moel Siabod. From the top of the mountain, it is reputedly possible to see 13 of the 14 highest peaks in Wales on a clear day without turning one's head.[1][2][3] \n",
        "description2": "The name Moel Siabod is wrongly translated as shapely hill, although William Williams in Observations on the Snowdon Mountains (1802) proposed that the name comes from siadod, meaning 'bare hill, whose head or crown is covered in new-fallen snow'. J. Lloyd-Jones M.A., B.Litt, of Dublin University, in his 'Enwau Lleoedd Sir Gaernarfon' 1928 (Cardiff), favours Middle English origin 'shabbèd', 'shcabbèd', 'shabbid', 'sceabbed(e)' ('scabbed' Modern English), therefore proposes a shabby, scabby, scarred mountain. \n",

        "description2": "The hill reaches a height of 859 metres (2818 feet) and qualifies as a Corbett and a Marilyn, although with a topographic prominence of 155 metres,[1] it only just meets the prominence criterion for these categories. Morrone very much belongs to the village of Braemar from which it is usually climbed, and with a starting elevation of 330 metres, it is an easy ascent and a unique one, being the only significant mountain climb in Scotland to start from the centre of a village.[2] Morrone is used for the Braemar Gathering hill race every September, and is a popular venue for paragliding and hang-gliding. The hill is occasionally referred to as Morven and it is given both names on Ordnance Survey maps, although Hamish Brown says I’ve never heard it called Morven.[3] In point of fact, the pronunciation of Morrone does not correspond closely with the pronunciation of Mór Shròn, and the derivation of Morrone is a complex question. Watson and Allan come down on the side of Mór Bheinn.[4] Morrone is not to be confused with Morven, the highest point in Caithness, or with the local Morven, a mere 29 km (18 mi) to the northeast.\n",

It lies on the western arm of the horseshoe which loops around Gleann na Ciche whose burns flow north to the River Affric.[8] West of the horseshoe is a deep glen connecting Cluanie and Affric – south of its watershed is An Caorran Mor with its stream flowing south to Loch Cluanie while to the north Allt a' Chomhlain flows north to the River Affric.[1] Mullach Fraoch-choire has a subsidiary Top on its northeast ridge at 1,047 metres (3,435 ft).[8] Somewhat beyond the lowest col on its south ridge is Stob Coire na Chràlaig at 1,008 metres (3,307 ft) which is regarded as a subsidiary peak of A' Chràlaig although it is more distant from the latter peak.[1][9]\n",

        "description1": "Mullach nan Coirean is a Scottish mountain situated in the Mamores group of hills. It reaches a height of 939 metres (3081 feet) and  is located eight kilometres north-west of Kinlochleven. It is the most westerly of the ten Munros in the Mamores and it is connected to the adjoining mountain of Stob Bàn by a bealach with a height of 846 metres; these two Munros are often climbed together from Glen Nevis.[3] The mountain's name translates from the Gaelic as Summit of the Corries[4] or Top of the Corries[5] and this is quite fitting as Mullach nan Coirean has four corries on its slopes. Mullach can also mean a \"roof\" [1]. However it is unusual that the name does not include reference to the mountain's distinct red tinge cause by its red granite rock.\n",
        "description2": "Mullach nan Coirean stands in stark contrast to the adjoining Stob Bàn, which is a pointed and light coloured peak, owing to its crown of quartzite. Mullach nan Coirean differs, being a large sprawling mountain of ridges and corries with its granite rock giving the mountain a definite red shade (see picture). The mountain has three north facing corries: the finest of these is Coire Dearg (Red Corrie) which is drained by the Allt a' Choire Dheirg into Glen Nevis and is overlooked by Mullach nan Coirean’s South East Top (917 metres) which is listed as a \"top\" in Munro's Tables.[2][6] The South East Top was previously called \"Coire Dearg Top\" but was changed to avoid confusion as the main summit also overlooks Coire Dearg. The other two northern corries are smaller: Coire Riabhach also drains to Glen Nevis while Coire a’ Mhuillinn empties further west into the River Kiachnish which delineates the mountain's western boundary. A fourth corrie, Coire Carach stands on the mountain's southern slopes.\n",

A popular ascent starts from Rhyd Ddu. On its western flank are the remains of ancient settlements and  field systems. The profile of Mynydd Mawr from the north is often thought to resemble an elephant lying down, and consequently the mountain is often colloquially also called \"Yr Eliffant\" ('The Elephant'), or \"Elephant Mountain\" by non-Welsh speakers.[1]\n",

To the north lies Moel Eilio and to the east is Moel Hebog and Snowdon. On exceptionally clear days, the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland can be seen westwards across the Irish Sea from the summit.\n",

It rises above the southern shores of the reservoir Llyn Celyn about 4 km northeast of its higher neighbour Arenig Fawr. Mynydd Nodol forms the backdrop in views from the A4212 car park by the dam. The hill throws down a broad shoulder to the east.\n",
        "description2": "The hill is formed from the acid ash-flow tuffs of the Llyn Conwy Formation of the Ordovician age Aran Volcanic Group. These same erosion-resistant volcanic rocks are responsible for several other hills and mountains in the area. Mudstones of the overlying Nant Hir Formation occur beneath the eastern slopes of the hill. Several intrusions of quartz-latite outcrop around the lower northern and western slopes of Mynydd Nodol though both these and the Nant Hir mudstones are partly obscured by glacial till which mantles the lower ground.[1] There are abandoned manganese mining levels and tips on the hill's northern and western flanks, recorded as being worked intermittently from 1867 for around 40 years.[2]\n",

It takes the form of a broad northwest-southeast ridge with numerous broad shoulders extending to the east, south and west, each of which have different names and some of which constitute minor tops. Listed clockwise from the north these are; Mynydd Maendy, Mynydd Ton, Mynydd Bwllfa, Mynydd Pwllyrhebog, Mynydd Maes-teg, Mynydd y Gwair and Mynydd yr Aber. The summit of the entire massif is often referred to as Mynydd Ton. Its western sides are open moorland whilst its eastern sides have been afforested by the Forestry Commission (now managed by Natural Resources Wales).\n",
        "description2": "The hill is formed from Pennant Sandstone overlying a great thickness of the South Wales Coal Measures. Several coal seams outcrop on its flanks including (in descending order) the No1 Rhondda Rider, No1 Rhondda and the No2 Rhondda. These and other strata are affected by several geological faults, the most significant of which are aligned roughly northwest – southeast. Landslips affect some of the steeper slopes of the hill, not least those above Price Town on its western side.[2][3]\n",

        "description2": "Na Gruagaichean is a Munro reaching a height of 1,056 m (3,465 ft) which makes it the 74th highest in the Munro classification and is located at the Eastern end of the Mamores range. Views of the summit are clear from the village and from the B863 road from Glencoe to Kinlochleven except when the peak is shrouded in year-round mist. The mountain is one of the most accessible from the village due in part to its relatively close proximity and well defined path leading most of the way to the summit. On Saturday 8 June 2019, a group of seven walkers were on Na Gruagaichean during a lightning storm. One was killed and another injured. HM Coastguard helicopter, Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team and Scotland's Air Ambulance service all aided the rescue effort.[1]\n",

It is named after its appearance as a pyramid from Wasdale, though it is dome-shaped from most other directions. It is one of the most popular of the Lakeland fells, and there are many different routes to the summit. Great Gable is linked by the high pass of Windy Gap to its smaller sister hill, Green Gable, and by the lower pass of Beck Head to its western neighbour, Kirk Fell.\n",
        "description2": "The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards, the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumbria. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells forming a horseshoe around this valley.[1]\n",

The surrounding terrain is characterized by laccolithic mountains flanked by precipitous cliffs, extensive talus aprons, forested mesas, canyons, and spacious, well-watered intermontane basins.[2] Needle Rock is an intrusive plug of monzonite porphyry[3] cropping out 3.5 miles (5.6 km) east-northeast (bearing 68°) of the Town of Crawford in Delta County, Colorado, United States.  At an elevation of 7,797 feet (2,377 m),[4] the towering rock spire stands 800 feet (240 m) tall above the floor of the Smith Fork of the Gunnison River valley.  The massive rock feature originated in the Oligocene geological epoch when magma intruded between existing sedimentary rocks[5] as the crown of a buried laccolith[3] or possibly the underlying conduit of a laccolith.[2] Subsequent erosion has exposed the prominent rock formation seen in the natural area today.\n",

At 891 metres (2,923 ft) it is the second highest Wainwright in the Helvellyn range, the highest of which is Helvellyn itself. It is located close to the southern end of the ridge, with Helvellyn to the north, and High Crag and Dollywaggon Pike to the south. Nethermost Pike, along with many of the Eastern Fells, lies between Thirlmere in the west and the Ullswater catchment in the east. The closest villages are Glenridding and Patterdale on the shores of Ullswater, over 8 kilometres (5 mi) away.\n",
        "description2": "Like most fells in the Helvellyn range, Nethermost Pike has grassy western slopes and rocky outcrops on the eastern side. Geologically, Nethermost Pike belongs to the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. Lead was once mined on its eastern slopes, resulting in open workings and underground mines. The eastern slopes are protected as part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of the Pike's geological and biological features, which include some of England's best arctic-alpine and tall-herb vegetation.\n",

        "description1": "The Newton Tors are large, free-standing residual masses (rock outcrop) that form the western rim of the Great Moor which runs from the market town of Wooler into the Cheviot Hills. They look down on the College Valley. The summit is at 537 metres (1,762 ft) which classifies it as a Dewey. Three separate outliers are known as Easter Tor, Wester Tor and Hare Law. Hare Law and Wester Tor are measured at 518m whilst Easter Tor is 438m in height.\n",
        "description2": "The most common access point is from the northern end. The three main starting points are from Kirknewton, Old Yeavering via St Cuthbert's Way or within the College Valley itself. These routes end up at the same point with a steep walk from Torleehouse between Yeavering Bell on one side and Easter Tor on the other side. Both access points follow the path of St Cuthbert's Way for a short time.\n",

A very recognisable and prominent peak of the Black Mountains, it lies near the end of the more westerly of Waun Fach's two broad southern ridges.  Its top Pen Twyn Glas is to the north, while its close neighbour Pen Cerrig-calch is to the south.[1] A prominent spur 1km to the SSW of the summit is known as Pen Gloch-y-pibwr. The stepped Bryniog ridge curves southward from this point.\n",

        "description1": "Pen Cerrig-calch is a subsidiary summit of Waun Fach in the Black Mountains in the Brecon Beacons National Park in southern Powys, Wales. Its summit, at a height of 701m (2,300 ft), is marked by a trig point. The peak sits high above the River Usk valley as it narrows above the small town of Crickhowell.The views from here are wide-ranging and extend as far as the Beacons themselves to the west. A ridge runs off to the northwest and the shoulder of Pen Gloch-y-pibwr then turns north to the secondary top of Pen Allt-mawr whose peak at 719m is also crowned by a trig point.[1]\n",
        "description2": "Like all of the hills in the Black Mountains, Pen Cerrig-calch is formed from mudstones and sandstones of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period but it is unusual in having a band of Carboniferous Limestone outcropping around the summit and giving rise to a few shakeholes.  A classic example of an outlier, the name of the hill reflects this situation; it means 'top of the limestone rock' in Welsh. The actual summit itself is formed from pebbly sandstone of the Marros Group (formerly the Millstone Grit Series), which also dates from the Carboniferous period. \nThe rounded southwestern shoulder of the hill ends abruptly at a cliff by the name of Darren (Welsh 'edge') which was formed by a sizeable landslip which most probably occurred in the early post-glacial period. There are many similar landslips in the Black Mountains, where weak strata have been eroded away, and destabilized the strata above. A large area of hummocky ground abounding with boulders of Old Red Sandstone lies across the slopes below Darren.[2]\n",

At 886 metres (2,907 ft) above sea-level, it is also the highest British peak south of Cadair Idris in Snowdonia.  It is the highest point (county top) of the historic county of Brecknockshire (though in modern administrative terms, it now lies within the unitary council area of Powys). The twin summits of Pen y Fan and Corn Du at 873 m (2,864 ft) were formerly referred to as Cadair Arthur or 'Arthur's Seat'.[1]\n",

The mountain is used by the military as part of the selection process of the UK's Special Forces personnel. Three soldiers who died after collapsing in the field in July 2013 were taking part in a Test March called Point-to-Point while undergoing Special Air Service selection.[2]\n",

Beneath these and forming the lower slopes are the sandstones of the Senni Formation (traditionally the Senni Beds). Mudstone layers within these sandstones are more readily eroded and have given rise to the stepped appearance of parts of the mountain, not least the summit section. Peat has accumulated on parts of the hill in the postglacial period, notably north towards Waun Fach.[2]\n",

It may be climbed from the hostel by a path that leads directly up the south west \"corner\", climbing 675 m in about 1.5 km (i.e. an average gradient of nearly 1 in 2). A slightly easier ascent involves starting from Tal-y-Llyn Ogwen, about a mile north-east from the hostel, following the stream until nearing the outflow from the mountain lake Ffynnon Lloer and then branching left to take the path up the ridge.\n",

Its summit is 557 metres (1,827 ft) above mean sea level. It gives its name to the Borough of Pendle. It is an isolated hill in the Pennines, separated from the South Pennines to the east, the Bowland Fells to the northwest, and the West Pennine Moors to the south. It is included in detached part of the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.[2]\n",

In the 13th century it was called Pennul or Penhul, apparently from the Cumbric pen and Old English hyll, both meaning \"hill\". The modern English \"hill\" was appended later, after the original meaning of Pendle had become opaque.[3]\n",

It reaches a height of 709 metres (2,326 feet) and is situated in the central part of the national park in the valley of Great Langdale. The fell is one of three fells which make up the picturesque Langdale Pikes (the others being Harrison Stickle and Loft Crag), one of the best-known areas in Lakeland. A \"stickle\" is a hill with a steep prominent rocky top, while a \"pike\" is a hill with a peaked summit, the name being therefore partly tautological.\n",
        "description2": "The Langdale Pikes form a raised rocky parapet around the southern and eastern edges of a high tableland centred upon Thunacar Knott. Pike of Stickle stands at the western end of this system and its crags fall south from the summit, presenting an arresting view from the valley floor 2,000 ft below, or from further afield.\n",

It is a substantial fell that is part of a long ridge that stretches for over six kilometres from Stonethwaite in Borrowdale up to the important mountain pass of Esk Hause. The summit of Glaramara at 783 m (2,569 ft) is the central point of this ridge, which separates the valleys of Langstrath and Grains Gill. However, the ridge has two additional fells, numerous subsidiary tops and several small tarns making its traverse an appealing and challenging walk.\n",
        "description2": "The fell’s unusual and pleasant-sounding name, previously only applied to the summit rocks, has now been accepted as the name for the whole fell. Like many fells of the district the name comes from a series of Old Norse words which in this case is translated as “Hill with the mountain hut by a chasm”.\n",

It may be considered an outlier of the Fairfield group in the Eastern Fells, but is separated from its neighbours by low cols. This gives Red Screes an independence[1] which is reflected in its prominence.\n",
        "description2": "Red Screes is a ridge of high ground which runs for nearly 7 km in a north north-easterly direction from the town of Ambleside, and reaches a maximum height of 776 m. This ridge narrows at either end, giving it the shape of a long upturned boat. It is separated from neighbouring fells by Scandale Pass to the west (c.516 m) and Kirkstone Pass to the east (455 m). These two low cols mean that Red Screes is seen as an independent fell when viewed from the south of the Lake District. They also give the fell sufficient prominence to be classified as a Marilyn. There are two minor subsidiary tops: Snarker Pike (644 m) on the south ridge and Middle Dodd (654 m) on the north ridge. Each of these, however, has very little prominence above the ridge (less than 10 m).\n",

Rest Dodd is a fell that is often by-passed by walkers as they travel the busy footpath between Ullswater and Haweswater either to climb the more significant fell of High Street or strive to complete Alfred Wainwright’s Coast to Coast Walk. Indeed Wainwright describes Rest Dodd as “A fell of little interest although the east flank falls spectacularly in fans of colourful scree”. The fell is usually climbed in conjunction with other nearby \"Wainwright\" fells such as The Nab, Brock Crags and Angletarn Pikes.\n",
        "description2": "Rest Dodd stands on the long ridge forming the boundary of the Martindale catchment, an extensive valley system emptying north into Ullswater. South east of Rest Dodd is The Knott and in the opposite direction is Brock Crags. A subsidiary ridge juts out north from Rest Dodd, ending at The Nab. This fell separates the heads of the Martindale valleys of Bannerdale and Rampsgill. A much shorter rocky spur also runs north west from Rest Dodd, divided from the Nab by Yewgrove Gill. The southern flank of the fell is formed by Hayeswater Gill.\n",

        "description1": "Rhinog Fawr is a mountain in Snowdonia, North Wales and forms part of the Rhinogydd range. It is the third highest summit of the Rhinogydd, losing out to Y Llethr and Diffwys respectively. Its smaller cousin Rhinog Fach lies to the south, separated by the pass of Bwlch Drws Ardudwy, while its other neighbour, Moel Ysgyfarnogod lies to the north.\n",
        "description2": "In common with most of the range, the terrain is characterised by hard sedimentary rock covered with heather, making progress on foot difficult. At 510m, nestled in crags, lies Llyn Du, a small tarn beneath the summit. The ascent is most easily made from the north-east or north-west, via the Roman Steps pass.[1]\n",

        "description2": "The apparent Roman road crosses the fell on its journey between the forts at Brougham (Brocavum) near Penrith and at Ambleside (Galava).[1] Situated in one of the quieter areas of the Lakes, the High Street range has quite gentle slopes with a flat summit plateau. It was these characteristics which may have persuaded Roman surveyors to build their road over the fell tops rather than through the valleys which, at the time, were densely forested and marshy thus making them susceptible to ambushes. The nature of the Roman road remains problematic however, as much of it is sunken in a hollow, rather than being built on top of an embankment or agger in the usual Roman fashion.\n",

It is not the pretty places - the flowery lanes of Grasmere or Derwentwater's wooded bays - that keep him restless in his bed; it is the magnificent ones. Places like Great End...\"[1]\n",

        "description2": "It lies just to the east of the famous Five Sisters of Kintail group of hills to which it is connected by the Bealach an Lapain (725 metres). It is part of a mountain group called the North Glen Shiel Ridge which also includes two other Munros (Sgurr a' Bhealaich Dheirg and Aonach Meadhoin) and with a height of  956 metres (3136 feet) it is the lowest of all the six Munros on the northern side of Glen Shiel, making the mountain's translated name of “The Little Heel” quite appropriate. Sàileag seems to have lost three metres of height in recent years, many older guide books have its height as 959 metres in comparison to 956 on the newer Ordnance Survey maps.\n",

        "description1": "Skiddaw is a mountain in the Lake District National Park in England. Its 931-metre (3,054 ft) summit is the sixth-highest in England. It lies just north of the town of Keswick, Cumbria, and dominates the skyline in this part of the northern lakes. It is the simplest of the Lake District mountains of this height to ascend (as there is a well-trodden tourist track from a car park to the north-east of Keswick, near the summit of Latrigg) and, as such, many walking guides recommend it to the occasional walker wishing to climb a mountain. This is the first summit of the fell running challenge known as the Bob Graham Round when undertaken in a clockwise direction.\n",
        "description2": "The mountain lends its name to the surrounding areas of ‘Skiddaw Forest’, and ‘Back o' Skidda' ’ and to the isolated ‘Skiddaw House’, situated to the east, formerly a shooting lodge and subsequently a youth hostel. It also provides the name for the slate derived from that region: Skiddaw slate. Tuned percussion musical instruments or lithophones exist which are made from the slate, such as the Musical Stones of Skiddaw held at the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery.\n",

        "description2": "The origin of the name is uncertain. Some sources say it derives from the Scots Language word scawed, meaning \"bare.\"[1] Others suggest that it derived from the Old Norse word sgat (meaning \"rent\") as cattle were pastured on the hill on payment of a rent.[2] A further explanation is that it derives from scaldberry, an old name for blackberry.[3][4] The word law is derived from the Old English for hill.\n",

The base of the hill is then reached across pathless boggy terrain, keeping the cliffs of Cadha Dearg to the north. The distance to the summit is 13.5 kilometres (8.4 mi) and will take the average hill climber just under 5 hours to reach. This makes Seana Bhràigh one of the two most inaccessible Scottish hills, along with A' Mhaighdean, north of Kinlochewe.[2] A ski approach is possible in winter, providing a \"superb\" run from the summit to Strath Mulzie.[3]\n",

Nevertheless, it tends to be overshadowed by its more illustrious neighbours in the Eastern Fells, Helvellyn and Fairfield.\n",
        "description2": "The fell's western flanks above Dunmail Raise are grassy and smooth while its eastern slopes are steep and craggy as they fall away towards Grisedale Hause which at 537 m (1,762 ft) contains Lakeland's highest substantial tarn, Grisedale Tarn. The fell reaches a height of 736 m (2,415 ft) and just scrapes into the list of Marilyns by being given prominence of ‘around’ 150 metres from the higher fell of Fairfield. However, this must be regarded as a borderline case as there is no Ordnance Survey surveyed height for the top of Grisedale Hause. Alfred Wainwright gives it a height of 1929 feet (588 metres) giving Seat Sandal a topographic prominence of only 148 metres (two metres short of Marilyn qualification). The hill's unusual name comes from the Norse language, meaning ‘Sandulfr’s Hill Pasture’, Sandulfr being an Old Norse personal name.[1]\n",

However, it is classed as a Marilyn because of the low elevation of the col connecting it to Haycock, its nearest higher neighbour to the north. The name Seatallan is believed to have a Cumbric origin, meaning \"Aleyn's high pasture\".\n",
        "description2": "The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.[1] Seatallan is an outlier of the southern arm.\n",

        "description1": "Seathwaite Fell is an area of the Lake District in Cumbria, England. It stands above the hamlet of the same name at the head of Borrowdale.\n",
        "description2": "The fell is very rugged with several small tops along the summit of the ridge. At the northern end is a peaked summit at 1,971 ft (601 m), very prominent from the valley below. Alfred Wainwright took this as the summit of the fell in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, even though he readily acknowledged that it wasn't the highest point. This is one of many subjective decisions which differentiate Wainwrights from more modern (and logical) hill lists such as Nuttalls and Hewitts. Wainwright stated that the 1,971 ft top was generally regarded as the summit of the fell, although he cited no references.[1] Other guidebooks have taken Wainwright's lead, Mark Richards stating Stand upon that (northern) pike and you know why tradition has ordained this to be the summit. The view down Borrowdale is peerless. A new generation of fellwalkers may arrive seeking to overthrow the traditional perception and feeling no compunction at adopting the highest ground as a summit.[2] Richards does at least acknowledge the highest point as a top, as does Birkett, who gives equal status to both.[3]\n",

Its rocky cone is indeed in great contrast to the grassy dome of High Raise.\n",

Sergeant Man is not actually visible from the peak of High Raise and Sergeant Man only comes into view as you gently descend from High Raise. South east, passing between Codale and Stickle Tarns is the broad spur leading to Blea Rigg, Silver How and Loughrigg. Sitting above Codale Tarn is the rocky subsidiary top of Codale Head — a grandchild of High Raise. From here further ridges run east to Tarn Crag and north east to Calf Crag and the circuit of Greenburn.\n",

        "description2": "Sgairneach Mhòr lies to the west of the A9 road in area of high ground which was historically called the Druim Uachdair (the ridge of the upper ground). It is a Munro and a Marilyn with a height of 991 metres (3251 feet). The hill is well seen from the Pass of Drumochter showing off its impressive north facing corrie Coire Creagach which holds snow well into the spring. This notable rocky corrie gives the  mountain its name which translates from the Gaelic as “Big Rocky Hillside” and this underlines the fact that Sgairneach Mhòr is the only hill in the group with any significant stony areas on its surface  and makes it the most visually striking of the Drumochter hills.[3][4]\n",

One ascends the mountain via a track starting in the pine woods, leading up into Coire Ruadh and thence to the summit by a number of indistinct paths. The other starts further south down Glen Feshie from a car-park just before the farm of Achlean and reaches the summit via the lower peak of Carn Ban Mòr (1,052 m).\n",

The north west face has precipitous cliffs which should be avoided by walkers, although these crags attract rock climbers with around 20 recognised traditional and winter climbs. The centre of the  crag is split by a large couloir (gully). There are plenty of easier routes on the crag.[2]\n",

        "description1": "Sgùrr Alasdair is the highest peak of the Black Cuillin, and the highest peak on the Isle of Skye and in the Inner Hebrides, and indeed in all the Scottish islands, at 992 m (3,255 ft). Like the rest of the range it is composed of gabbro, a rock with excellent grip for mountaineering. It is named after Alexander Nicolson, who made the first recorded ascent in 1873.[2] Prior to this the mountain had been locally known as Sgurr Biorach.[3]\n",
        "description2": "As with other hills of the Cuillin, a head for heights and scrambling ability are needed to attain the summit. The least technical route follows a feature known as the \"Great Stone Chute\", a scree gully that leads up from the corrie of Coire Lagan to a col just below the main ridge. From this col, a pleasant scramble (Grade 2 standard) up the well scratched east ridge leads to the narrow summit.[4]\n",

The summit (one of the sharpest in the Cuillin[5]) is at the western end of the narrow summit ridge. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1874 by Alexander Nicolson and  Duncan MacIntyre, a local forester and hillwalker. Sgùrr Dubh Beag lies a further one kilometre to the east beyond Sgùrr Dubh Mòr.[6] These mountains are situated on the gabbro Dubh ridge which traverses east from Sgùrr Dubh an Da Bheinn and eventually reaches Loch Coruisk.[1][note 1]\n",

Sgùrr a' Bhealaich Dheirg is the highest of the three Brothers with a height of 1036 metres (3399 feet). The mountain's name translates from Gaelic as “Peak of the Red Pass” but the Red Pass (Bhealaich Dheirg) is not marked on Ordnance Survey maps so its exact location is uncertain.\n",

Viewed from Kinloch Hourn to the west, or from the north, it shows large, steep, rocky flanks with a complex series of ridges and corries, but like its neighbours such as Gleouraich, its southern side is gentler and grassier.[2]\n",
        "description2": "The mountain was originally known as Sgùrr a' Mhoraire, meaning peak of the landowner, but has been changed on modern maps to Sgùrr a' Mhaoraich, which may be derived from the Gaelic maorach meaning shellfish. This may be a reference to the hill's ribbed summit, which has been said to resemble a shell.[3]\n",

Knowledge of ropes are likely to be required until the summit is reached. In winter it is advised not to attempt unless well acquainted with ice climbing as well as the use of crampons and ice axes. It is strongly advised to hire a Sherpa from the local climbers watering hole the Old Inn, Carbost, available for a reasonable price. Even the most experienced of climbers get caught out by the Three Boys’ in winter. There is much steep ground and scree in winter and it is a place of deep snow and vast ice sheets. \n",
        "description2": "Other routes require yet more scrambling ability, including the excellent ridge running out to Sgùrr nan Gobhar (Grade 1/2) which can be extremely treacherous in winter. In both directions, the main Cuillin ridge requires world class scrambling ability;  the continuation southwards towards Sgùrr Dearg is rated Grade 2 grade 5 in winter, and the NE ridge towards Sgùrr Thormaid is a Grade 5 grade 7 in winter (Sherpa highly advisable).\n",

Though a fine mountain in its own right, it is overshadowed by its near neighbour The Saddle, regarded as one of the finest mountains in Scotland. Sgùrr na Sgine is not well seen from the A87 road to the north east.  The best view from valley level is from the remote country to the south west.  It looks particularly fine from the top of the Mam Barrisdale pass from where it takes on a more dramatic appearance than The Saddle.[2] The mountain's name translates from the Gaelic as \"Peak of the Knife\". This is thought to refer to a wall of rock beneath the summit on its eastern flank which takes on a blade like appearance from some angles.[3]\n",

        "description1": "Sgùrr nan Ceathreamhnan is a Scottish mountain that is situated in the remote and lonely mountainous country between Glen Affric and Glen Elchaig, some 30 kilometres east of Kyle of Lochalsh in the Highland region. With a height of 1151 metres (3776 feet) it is ranked as the third highest mountain north of the Great Glen (after Carn Eighe and Mam Sodhail) and is regarded as one of the finest hills in the whole of the United Kingdom. It is different from the other neighbouring Affric Hills, characterised by sweeping flanks and long slender ridges, which emerge from the central summit crest in the manner of the spokes of a wheel.\n",
        "description2": "Sgùrr nan Ceathreamhnan is rated as one of the remotest Munros and a great prize for any hill walker, with E.J. Yeaman in his Handbook of the Scottish Hills regarding Ceathreamhnan as the fourth most difficult Scottish Munro to climb, taking into account its remote position and its altitude. It is a massive mountain which covers 24 square miles (62 square km) and stands many kilometres from the nearest public road, it has a tent like appearance and throws down many long ridges to the valleys. It has five subsidiary “tops”, three of these stand on the northern ridge, they are Stuc Bheag (1075 metres), Stuc Mòr (1041 metres) and Stob Fraoch Choire (918 metres). The Western Top (1143 metres) is also regarded as a \"top\". Stob Coire na Cloiche (915 metres) on the eastern ridge was removed as a Munro Top. In addition to this Sgùrr nan Ceathreamhnan has three tops which have been deleted from the list over the years, making a total of eight distinct summits on the mountain in addition to the highest point. Its outlier to the north east, Mullach na Dheiragain, is regarded as a separate Munro.\n",

        "description1": "Sgùrr nan Eugallt is the highest of a well defined group of mountains that lie south of Loch Hourn, stretching from Barrisdale to Loch Quoich. Although its summit is lower than many nearby neighbours, it is cut off from all its higher neighbours by a ring of deep glens. Despite being in a very wild and remote area, it can be easily ascended from a ruined roadside cottage 4 km to the east of its summit, where there is limited parking space. But the road is single track and the cottage is 20 miles from the nearest main road. Due to its isolation and insufficient height to qualify for Munro's Tables, Sgùrr nan Eugallt is infrequently climbed. \n",
        "description2": "An old stalkers' path from the ruined cottage should guide the climber to a point just below a ridge at about 650 metres. The path was well built in its time but some sections have become wet and slippery. On gaining the ridge, turn left and follow the ridge to the 894 m triangulation point. The ridge becomes steep near the top but the steepest section can be bypassed. Contrary to the implication of the 1:50,000 Landranger map, several websites and the 1990 edition of the Scottish Mountaineering Club publication The Corbetts and other Scottish Hills, the true summit lies about 600 metres to the north west of the triangulation point.[1] List tickers should therefore turn right along the main ridge of the range and continue for about 600 metres to the main summit, which is not shown on any map. About 300 m further along the ridge is an 881 m summit, which is shown on topographic maps.\n",

        "description1": "Sgùrr nan Gillean is a mountain in the northern section of the Cuillin range on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. With a height of 966.1 metres (3,169 feet 7 inches), it is one of eleven Munros in the Cuillin ridge. It is the Munro closest to Sligachan, and its impressive triangular profile is visible behind the Sligachan hotel, making it perhaps the most recognised peak in the Cuillin range.\n",
        "description2": "The most popular route of ascent, known as the Tourist Route, follows a path leading south and west from Sligachan, crossing a burn known as the Allt Dearg Beag (small red burn). The route continues up into a corrie, the Coire Rhiabhach. The ascent of the coire headwall is on loose rock and scree. The continuation up the southeast ridge to the summit is exposed, and calls for scrambling ability. The path up is very narrow so calls for single file when a party ascends. The top is a ridge which must be traversed to reach the final summit, and like the climb, needs some scrambling ability. All sides are very exposed, and extra care is needed if mist descends. The small airy summit platform is surprisingly smooth and flat with outstanding views.\n",

        "description1": "Crinkle Crags is a fell in the English Lake District in the county of Cumbria. It forms part of two major rings of mountains, surrounding the valleys of Great Langdale and Upper Eskdale. The name reflects the fell's physical appearance as its summit ridge is a series of five rises and depressions (crinkles) that are very distinctive from the valley floor. In Old English, cringol means twisted or wrinkled.\n",
        "description2": "The nomenclature of the various tops is very confused. Traditional guidebooks tend to rely on what the eye sees and therefore focus attention upon the five ‘crinkles’ of the summit ridge. These are generally referred to as the first to fifth crinkles, but Richards[1] starts in the north, Birkett[2]  in the south and Wainwright[3]  employs both conventions, depending upon the direction of travel. For clarity in this article the first crinkle will be taken as the southernmost top. On this basis, the second Crinkle (also called Long Top) is the true summit of the fell. The only other Crinkle with a definitive name is Gunson Knott, but this name is used variously for the third and the fifth, with both the Ordnance Survey[4][5] and the Database of British and Irish Hills[6][7] listing it twice. To the north of the Crinkles proper is a depression and then the outcropping continues over Shelter Crags. \n",

However, unlike its neighbours, the ridge connecting Shillhope Law to the higher dome of The Cheviot to the north is bisected by a low col at 343 metres (1,125 ft) m, giving it enough relative height to be a Marilyn.\n",

On the other side of the valley lies the Otterburn Training Area and training (without live ammunition) can take place on the northern side of Shillhope Law. Shillhope Law can be easily climbed from the farms on its western side, Barrowburn and Shillmoor, although the ascent is steep. These two climbs can be combined to give a circular walk of about 5 miles (8.0 km).\n",

        "description1": "Shipman Knotts is a fell in the English Lake District in Cumbria, England. It reaches a height of 587 metres (1,926 ft) and is situated in one of the quieter areas of the national park, 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north-east of Kentmere village. Although not one of the best-known Lake District fells and strictly speaking it is just the southern shoulder of Kentmere Pike it earned a separate chapter in Alfred Wainwright’s Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells due to “Its characteristic roughness…rocky outcrops are everywhere on its steep slopes”.\n",
        "description2": "The ridge from Shipman Knotts to Kentmere Pike climbs due north as far as the cairned top of  Goat Scar (2,053 feet (626 m)), before turning north-west to complete its journey. A wall follows the ridge although in places it zigzags abruptly off the watershed. The eastern face above Longsleddale is steeper and includes Rough Crags and Goat Scar itself. The western face is rough but, after the initial climb out of Kentmere, has shallower gradients. There are small areas of mixed woodland on both sides.\n",

        "description2": "Little Man is often overlooked and disregarded as an independent and distinct fell due to its name which makes it sound like a minor top of its parent fell Skiddaw which in fact lies 1.5 kilometres to the north west. With a topographical prominence of 61 metres, Little Man qualifies comfortably as a Hewitt and Nuttall hill and is regarded as a separate fell by renowned mountain writers Alfred Wainwright and Bill Birkett. The fell is actually called Little Man on Ordnance Survey maps and by many guide books.\n",

Slight Side lies at the south western edge of the Scafell Massif, a four-kilometre-long crescent of high ground which includes the highest ground in England. The fells names derives from the Old Norse language and means \"The mountain shieling with the level pastures\", it is a combination of the Norse words \"sletta\" and \"saetr\". With a shieling meaning a shepherds hut or a mountain pasture used in the summer.\n",
        "description2": "When viewed from the valley of Eskdale the fell is seen as a distinct peak but in reality it is just the terminal point on Scafell’s southern ridge before it descends steeply to Eskdale. It only has 14 metres of topographic prominence between itself and Scafell (the col is at 748 metres) and therefore narrowly fails to qualify as a Nuttall  hill or a Hewitt and it is left to Alfred Wainwright to give Slight Side the status of a separate fell in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells.\n",

It is located in Snowdonia National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) in Gwynedd (historic county of Caernarfonshire). It is the busiest mountain in the United Kingdom and the third most visited attraction in Wales; in 2019 it was visited by 590,984 walkers,[3] with an additional 140,000 people taking the train.[4] It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna.\n",

The cliff faces on Snowdon, including Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, are significant for rock climbing, and the mountain was used by Edmund Hillary in training for the 1953 ascent of Mount Everest.\n",

        "description2": "Sròn a’ Choire Ghairbh reaches a height of 937 metres (3074 feet) and is classified as both a Munro and a Marilyn. It is highest of the Loch Lochy hills and is invariably climbed along with the neighbouring Munro of Meall na Teanga to which it is joined by the distinctive col of the Cam Bhealach. Both these hills which are often referred to as the Loch Lochy Munros are well seen from the A82 road on the opposite side of the loch, showing steep slopes which are forested below the 300 metre contour. There are also extensive conifer plantings on the lower northern (Glen Garry) side of the mountain, this is gradually being restored to native species.[2] The hills name translates from the Gaelic as The Nose of the Rough Corrie[3] referring to the summits location on the edge of the craggy Coire Glas, which stands to the east.\n",

It is a prominent feature in the Patterdale skyline, with a distinctive rounded shape. Indeed, it figures so finely in views from the upper reach of the lake that it is sometimes referred to as ‘the Ullswater Fell’.[1]\n",
        "description2": "St Sunday Crag is the high point on the north-eastern ridge of Fairfield, which runs for two miles before descending to the valley floor behind Patterdale village. From the flat Fairfield summit a rough slope descends over the subsidiary top of Cofa Pike to the col at Deepdale Hause at c680 m (2,200 ft). This is a narrow point on the ridge, deeply scarred by pedestrian traffic. The ground now rises again to St Sunday Crag, soaring above the fells on either side. Beyond the summit there is a swift drop to the lower plateau of Birks and beyond this is the further satellite of Arnison Crag.\n",

The peak displays a rocky crest of Torridonian sandstone, with many pinnacles and steep gullies. The ridge was exposed to weathering as a nunatak above the ice sheet during  the last Ice Age, while the ice flow carved and scoured the smooth sides of the mountain.[1]\n",
        "description2": "The modern Gaelic name is a recent invention. The peak is named on the first edition Ordnance Survey maps simply as \"An Stac\" (the pinnacle) and on later maps as \"Stac Polly\". The \"Polly\" element is of Norse origin, derived from \"Pollå\" meaning \"pool river\".[citation needed]  Due to its relatively low height of just over 2000 feet, fine views and ease of access from a road it has become a very popular peak to climb. It also provides some fine scrambling in the traverse of the summit ridge, including one bad step near the final summit. Consequentially it has suffered from a great deal of erosion, leading to Scottish Natural Heritage constructing a large path.\n",

During the last Ice Age Stiperstones lay on the eastern margin of the Welsh ice sheet. The hill itself was not glaciated though glaciers occupied surrounding valleys and it was subject to intense freezing and thawing which shattered the quartzite into a mass of jumbled scree surrounding several residual rocky tors.[2] At 536 metres (1,759 ft) above sea level it is the second-highest hill in the county, surpassed only by Brown Clee Hill (540 metres (1,772 ft)). Stiperstones' 8-kilometre (5 mi) summit ridge is crowned by several jagged outcrops of rock, which may be seen silhouetted against the sky.\n",

        "description1": "Stob Coire Easain is a Scottish Munro mountain which reaches a height of 1115 metres (3658 feet), situated 18 kilometres east of Fort William. It stands on the western side of Loch Treig, along with its \"twin\", the Munro Stob a' Choire Mheadhoin (1105 metres). Collectively the pair are called \"The Easains\" or the \"Stob Corries\"[2] and stand just one kilometre apart connected by a high col with an approximate height of 965 metres. The fine corrie of Coire Easain Beag lies in between the two mountains facing north west. Stob Coire Easain’s name translates from the Gaelic as “Peak of the Corrie of the Little Waterfall”.[3] This mountain should not be confused with another Stob Coire Easain, a Munro “Top” on the Munro Stob Coire an Laoigh\n",
        "description2": "The Easains stand in splendid isolation, hemmed in by valleys on three sides, giving Stob Coire Easain a substantial topographic prominence of 611 metres.[4] The mountain is the highest point on a nine kilometre long ridge which runs the entire length of the western side of Loch Treig; the eastern side of this ridge drops very steeply to the waters of the loch. To the west of the mountain is the valley of the Allt na Lairig. A subsidiary ridge going north from the summit is initially steep and craggy as it descends to the head of Coire Laire. To the south of the summit the main ridge descends gently over Irlick Chaoile to the lonely country at the head of Loch Treig. All drainage from the mountain goes into the River Spean to find its way to the west coast of Scotland via Loch Linnhe.\n",

        "description2": "The mountain is usually climbed in conjunction with Bidean nam Bian, thus allowing for a traverse of the range. One of the most common routes from Glen Coe is to ascend the head of Coire Gabhail (the Hidden Glen or Lost Valley) to reach the bealach between Stob Coire Sgreamhach and Bidean nam Bian. The wide floor of this corrie is hidden from view when seen from Glen Coe, and was used by the local Clan MacDonald to hide livestock, whether their own or stolen on raids.\n",

It is a complex mountain, taking the form of a flat summit plateau from which five ridges radiate, and is most famed for the cliffs surrounding the corrie of Coire Ardair on the north-eastern face.[3] These crags are a renowned venue for winter and ice climbing, although being somewhat vegetated they are less suited to summer climbing.[4]\n",
        "description2": "The name Creag Meagaidh is also applied to refer to the neighbouring peaks of Stob Poite Coire Ardair and Càrn Liath which together may be termed the Creag Meagaidh range. All three peaks in the range may be climbed from Aberarder on the A86 road by initially following the path leading up Coire Ardair, before striking north to the summit of Càrn Liath. A circuit of the glen may be made by returning to Aberarder by way of Creag Meagaidh's east ridge. The most direct route to the summit of Creag Meagaidh ascends from the head of the corrie to reach a narrow gap between the crags known as The Window. The Window forms the bealach between Creag Meagaidh and Stob Poite Coire Ardair. Creag Meagaidh may also be climbed from Moy to the southeast.[3]\n",

The name reflects the fell's physical appearance as its summit ridge is a series of five rises and depressions (crinkles) that are very distinctive from the valley floor. In Old English, cringol means twisted or wrinkled.\n",
        "description2": "The nomenclature of the various tops is very confused. Traditional guidebooks tend to rely on what the eye sees and therefore focus attention upon the five ‘crinkles’ of the summit ridge. These are generally referred to as the first to fifth crinkles, but Richards[1] starts in the north, Birkett[2]  in the south and Wainwright[3]  employs both conventions, depending upon the direction of travel. For clarity in this article the first crinkle will be taken as the southernmost top. On this basis, the second Crinkle (also called Long Top) is the true summit of the fell. The only other Crinkle with a definitive name is Gunson Knott, but this name is used variously for the third and the fifth, with both the Ordnance Survey[4][5] and the Database of British and Irish Hills[6][7] listing it twice. To the north of the Crinkles proper is a depression and then the outcropping continues over Shelter Crags. \n",

        "description1": "Stony Cove Pike (alternatively known as Caudale Moor /kʊərdeɪl mʊər/  or John Bell's Banner) is a fell in the Far Eastern part of the English Lake District. It stands on the other side of the Kirkstone Pass from Red Screes, and is on the end of a ridge coming down from High Street. It is separated from its neighbours by the deep col of Threshthwaite Mouth, so is a Marilyn (a hill with topographic prominence of at least 150m) – the sixteenth highest in the Lake District.\n",
        "description2": "There is considerable variation over use of the alternative names for the fell. The Ordnance Survey maps name the main summit as 'Stony Cove Pike', the second top to the west as 'Caudale Moor' and 'John Bell's Banner' is reserved for the south west ridge descending to St Raven's Edge. Alfred Wainwright in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells uses Caudale Moor for the fell as a whole, John Bell's Banner as an alternative to this and Stony Cove Pike as a name for the (main) summit. Bill Birkett prefers the Ordnance Survey scheme, but with John Bell's Banner as a second name for the subsidiary top.[1]\n",

Helvellyn was one of the earliest fells to prove popular with walkers and explorers; beginning especially in the later 18th century. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached from all directions.\n",

It rivals the Old Man of Coniston as the highest point within the traditional County Palatine of Lancashire[2] (it has been administered since 1974 by Cumbria County Council for local government purposes).\n",
        "description2": "The Coniston (or Furness) Fells form the watershed between Coniston Water and the Duddon valley to the west. The range begins at Wrynose Pass and runs south for around 10 miles before petering out at Broughton in Furness on the Duddon Estuary. Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells took only the northern half of the range as Lakeland proper, consigning the lower fells to the south to a supplementary work The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.  Swirl How being a significant high point of the Coniston Fells therefore qualifies as one of the 214 Wainwrights. Later guidebook writers have chosen to include the whole range in their main volumes.[3][4]\n",

It divides the valleys of Bannerdale and Rampsgill, which meet below the nose of the ridge to form How Grain. The sides of the ridge are steep and rough, but the top is broad and level. It is scarred by peat hags, some deeper than a man.\n",

        "description1": "The Old Man of Coniston is a fell in the Furness Fells in the Cumbria, English Lake District and is the highest point (county top) of the historic county of Lancashire.[2] It is at least 2,632.62 feet (802.42 m) high, and lies to the west of the village of Coniston and the lake, Coniston Water. The fell is sometimes known by the alternative name of Coniston Old Man, or simply The Old Man. The mountain is popular with tourists and fell-walkers with a number of well-marked paths to the summit. The mountain has also seen extensive copper and slate mining activity for eight hundred years, and the remains of abandoned mines and spoil tips are a significant feature of the north-east slopes. There are also several flocks of sheep that are grazed on the mountain.[3]\n",
        "description2": "A detailed survey on 24 May 2018[1] measured the height of the highest visible natural ground to be 802.42 metres (2632'7¼\"). The height of the ground on the summit plinth (man-made ground) is 803.53 metres (2636'3\").\n",

The mountain was originally known by its Gaelic name of An Dìollaid but this has now been lost through common usage of its English translation and it is now one of the few mountains in highland Scotland with an English name.[2]\n",

It comprises little more than one top, which stands on the west bank of the River Clyde, some 8 kilometres (5 mi) west of Biggar. The peak is also called \"Tinto Tap\", with the name Tinto possibly deriving from the Scottish Gaelic word teinnteach, meaning \"fiery\", which may refer to its ancient past as a look out beacon. Further known as the \"Hill of Fire\" it is also suggested[by whom?] exposed red hue felsite rock visible in many places on the hill helped gave rise to this name due to the effect seen when a setting sun illuminates the hillside.\n",
        "description2": "At the summit sits \"Tinto Cairn\", and with a diameter of 45 m (148 ft) and a height of 6 m (20 ft) it is one of the largest Bronze Age round cairns in Scotland, most of which are found at lower elevations.[3]\n",

        "description1": "Tryfan (/ˈtrʌvæn/) is a mountain in the Ogwen Valley, Snowdonia, Wales. It forms part of the Glyderau group, and is one of the most recognisable peaks in Britain, having a classic pointed shape with rugged crags. At 917.5 metres (3,010 feet) above sea level, it is the fifteenth-highest mountain in Wales. The name \"Tryfan\" is thought to derive from the intensifying particle try– and the noun ban (‘top, peak’), giving the meaning ‘very high peak’.[3] Tryfan was voted Britain's favourite mountain by Trail magazine.[4]\n",
        "description2": "Between the mid-1980s and June 2010, its accepted height was 915 metres (3,002 ft). However, it was resurveyed using accurate GPS measurements and found to be 2.4 metres (eight feet) higher.[1] Until the 1980s, Ordnance Survey maps gave its height as 917.5 m (3,010 ft), and so the new measurement confirms that the earlier survey was correct.\n",

        "description1": "Twmpa or Lord Hereford's Knob is a mountain in south-east Wales, forming a part of the great northwest scarp of the Black Mountains. It lies 1.86 miles (3 km) west of the border with England, and around 4.34 miles (7 km) south of Hay-on-Wye. To the northeast lies the Gospel Pass through which runs a minor road between Hay and the Llanthony Valley. A ridge known as Darren Lwyd tapers away for about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the southeast of the summit.\n",
        "description2": "In common with neighbouring hills, Twmpa is composed of alternate layers of sandstone and mudstone dating from the Devonian period and ascribed to the Lower Old Red Sandstone. Its lower slopes are formed from the mudstone-dominated St Maughans Formation whilst the upper part of the hill is composed of sandstone-dominated Senni Formation rocks. At the junction between the two is a prominent calcrete known as the Ffynnon Limestone.\n",

White markers supposedly point out the way, but more often result in leading the walker astray. The second trig points faces the empty vastness of the eastern Forest of Bowland, with the summits of Wolfhole Crag, White Hill and the distant Ingleborough breaking the horizon. A second path approaches Ward's Stone from Tarnbrook, where limited parking is available. \n",

        "description1": "Waun Lefrith is a top of Picws Du and is also the westernmost of the Carmarthen Fans or Bannau Sir Gaer, a group of peaks within the Black Mountain (Y Mynydd Du) of the Brecon Beacons National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog).  It lies within Carmarthenshire, Wales. The summit plateau of the mountain reaches a height of 2221 feet above sea level. Picws Du and Fan Foel are the other, higher summits of the Bannau Sir Gaer / Carmarthen Fans.[1] The glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fach dominates the panorama to the north of the peak. Beyond the lake to the north lies the Usk Reservoir and then the Cambrian Mountains on the horizon. Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel are visible to the south across the undulating dip slope of the mountain. The Tywi valley lies to the west, with Llandovery and Llandeilo as important market towns \nnearest to the hills.\n",
        "description2": "Waun Lefrith is formed from the sandstones and mudstones of the Brownstones Formation of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period. Its southern slopes are formed from the hard-wearing sandstones of the overlying Plateau Beds Formation which are of upper/late Devonian age. It is those rocks which form vertical crags along the top edge of the scarp. The northern face of Waun Lefrith was home to a glacier during the ice ages which gouged out the cwm in which Llyn y Fan Fach now sits. This empties via the Afon Sawdde into the River Towy. The southern slopes drain via the Twrch Fechan, the Nant Menyn and Nant Lluestau into the Afon Twrch and so into the River Tawe.[2]\nLarge moraines occur to the east of the summit at the base of the scarp, and below the prominent peak of Picws Du as well as those damming the Lake.\n",

        "description1": "West Lomond is the highest point in the county of Fife, Scotland and the highest peak in the Lomond Hills. Its cone-shaped summit, which is the remains of a volcanic plug, rises above an escarpment of Carboniferous sandstone and limestone layers, capped with a quartz-microgabbro sill.[1] The conspicuous peaks of West Lomond, and its neighbour East Lomond, are visible for many miles around, which explains one suggested origin of their name, the 'Lomond' or 'beacon' hills. On the summit are the remains of an Iron Age hill fort.\n",
        "description2": "West Lomond is usually climbed from Craigmead car park on the Falkland-Leslie road which is at a height of almost 300 metres. Another route of ascent leaves from the Bunnet Stane and climbs diagonally up the steep north slopes of the escarpment to a gap in the cliffs, gaining the plateau a short distance from the summit cone. This route is steeper and begins at a much lower altitude than the Craigmead car park.\n",

        "description1": "Whinlatter is a small fell in the north west of the English Lake District, just north of the Whinlatter Pass. It is easily climbed from the top of the Whinlatter Pass, through the Forestry Commission plantations. The Whinlatter Visitor's Centre, a popular tourist attraction, is on the south side of the fell. The hill is part of a horseshoe around the valley of Aiken Beck. The fell's name originates from a combination of the Old Norse and Gaelic languages. With the Old Norse word 'hvin' meaning gorse or furze, and the Gaelic word 'lettir' meaning slope, the name translates as \"The Gorse or furze-covered slope.\".[1]\n",
        "description2": "The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. Whinlatter is in the most northerly sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and the Vale of Embleton.\n",

        "description1": "White Coomb is a hill in the Moffat Hills range, part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland. Its broad summit is the highest point in the range and the registration county of Dumfriesshire, as well as being the fourth highest point in southern Scotland, however, despite this, it is largely concealed by other hills on all sides except its east and south east, making this the only direction from which its full scale can be seen.\n",
        "description2": "White Coomb is most easily climbed from the National Trust for Scotland car park underneath the Grey Mare's Tail waterfall, on the A708 from Moffat to Selkirk, at NT 186146. The most direct route heads directly west up a steep ridge, but a more comfortable route follows a well built footpath above the north side of the waterfall. Above the waterfall, the fast flowing Tail Burn must be crossed to avoid a long detour; although there are plenty of natural stepping stones, spate or icy conditions may make their use dangerous. From across the stream, the best route through the peat and heather follows the course of a wall leading to the summit of Upper Tarnberry. From there, the east ridge, which is steep and craggy in places, leads to the broad summit.\n",

It stands immediately east of Crummock Water and forms a pyramid shape when viewed from Rannerdale. In his celebrated guide to the Lakeland fells, Alfred Wainwright called it \"the Weisshorn of Buttermere\".[1]  There are good views of Great Gable and the Scafells from the summit.\n",

Views from the summit include the full length of the Duddon Valley including its estuary; the western side of the Coniston fells; the Eskdale fells including Scafell and Bowfell; much of western Cumbria including the estuary of the Rivers Esk, Mite and Irt; the Isle of Man; as well as the hills to the south culminating in Black Combe.\n",

A bridleway crosses the fell to the north of the summit, but it is probably more frequently visited on a round including Burn Moor at 1,780 feet (540 m), Kinmont Buck Barrow at 1,754 feet (535 m), and Buck Barrow at 1,799 feet (548 m) from the summit of the Corney Fell road, a route described by Alfred Wainwright in the \"Whit Fell\" chapter of his book The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.[2]\n",

        "description1": "Windy Gyle is a mountain in the Cheviot Hills range, on the border between England and Scotland.[4] Like the other hills in the area, it is rounded and grass-covered. It is the highest summit on the border, although not the highest point as the border is higher where it runs along the western shoulder of The Cheviot, at a point called Cairn Hill West Top, or Hangingstone Hill.[5]  The cairn at the summit of this hill is named Russell's Cairn and has a small depression suitable for shielding about 15 people from the wind; the border runs directly through the cairn although this can only be seen on the map, the fence which follows it in many places is absent here. The Pennine Way crosses the summit, thus providing one possible route of ascent. Windy Gyle may also be climbed from the Coquet valley to the south (England), or from Cocklawfoot to the north (Scotland).[6] There are good views from the summit north towards the Scottish Borders, Eildon Hills and Edinburgh and south across the southern Cheviot Hills to the North Pennines.\n",

        "description1": "Wolfhole Crag is a lonely and seldom-visited hill in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, England. Its seclusion is due in part to its low profile and long approach walks.  A long path approaches from Ward's Stone in the west which is fraught with bogs. Another tarmac path from Tarnbrook meets this half way. A final path comes from the north east from the Hornby Road in the direction to White Hill. The summit consists of two large (10m high) buttresses of gritstone some unusually shaped waist-high rocks and the usual trig point. The buttresses contain a number of recorded rock climbs, including the two farthest \"hard grit\" routes (E7 & E6) from the road in the entire UK. Both climbs were ascended in 2001 by Neil Kershaw and Greg Chapman. It's quite possible to not see another human being all day there.\nThe East crag has a 'Wolf hole' at the base of the south facing side, presumably how it originally gained the name.\nWolfhole Crag marks the northwesternmost boundary of the civil parish of Bowland Forest High, the historic Forest of Bowland as well as the Lordship of Bowland.\n",

        "description1": "Yr Arddu is a large hill in Snowdonia, Wales (Not to be confused with the 589 metre Yr Arddu (North) to the east of Snowdon). It lies approximately 2.5 km south east of the village of Beddgelert and just over 1 km from the rather more famous mountain Cnicht. It is a rugged hill with widespread rock outcrops and cliffs. A small lake, Llyn yr Arddu, is located on the flanks of the mountain. The recognised summit is at 388m to the South of the hill, but the highest point, named Cerrig-y-Myllt on only the most detailed UK Ordnance Survey mapping, is at 463m above the two small lakes to the North of the hill.\nThe craggy nature of the hill is due to the presence of lavas and tuffs (volcanic ash deposits) dating from the Ordovician period when Snowdonia was characterised by numerous volcanic eruptions; Yr Arddu is a particularly good location to see the record of Ordovician volcanism. The Yr Arddu Tuffs may be the earliest eruptive phase of the Lower Rhyolitic Tuff Formation.[1]\n",

        "description1": "Yr Elen is a mountain in the Carneddau range in Snowdonia, Wales. It is the ninth highest mountain in Snowdonia.  The average annual temperature of the peak is around 4 °C (39 °F). It lies on a short ridge running north-northwest off the main northeast-to-southwest ridge of the Carneddau, just over one kilometre from Carnedd Llewelyn. \n",
        "description2": "It is usually climbed from the main ridge of the Carneddau, as it is only a short walk from Carnedd Llywelyn. It can also be climbed from Gerlan, near Bethesda, following Afon Llafar then heading up the slopes of Yr Elen, but this involves walking through wet valleys and a number of rivers that are difficult to cross.[1] In drier times, ascent can be made via the crossing of Afon Caseg and then up the \"front edge\" of the peak. The views from this point north-west, over to Bangor and Anglesey, are stunning on a clear day, especially with a summer's sunset. This is well worth the arduous ascent.\n",
