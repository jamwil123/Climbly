# Climbly

Climbly is a mountain/hill collection app. Climbly was built for our final group project with NorthCoders.

The application allows users to sign up, check off mountains or hills that they have climbed and view checked off mountains as pins on a UK map. Users are able to search for mountains based on name, height and location. Users can also check each locations weather ahead of time.
